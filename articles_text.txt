"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  INDIANAPOLIS -- Jason Whitlock is speaking out against Black Lives Matter, calling it a \"cleverly marketed slogan that provides cover for extremists to undermine racial progress and bully American citizens to support Democrat politicians.\"  And that, Whitlock said, is exactly what the Ku Klux Klan was all about.  \"Despite the sweet-sounding name, Black Lives Matter acts as a racial divider,\" Whitlock wrote in an email to IndyStar on Friday, \"no different from the KKK.\"  Whitlock, an Indianapolis native and journalist at Outkick.com, known for his controversial takes on sports and race issues, went on Fox News Wednesday night with Tucker Carlson. In that interview he said Black Lives Matter and Antifa serve as the modern-day “enforcement arm” of the Democratic Party.  When asked by IndyStar to expound on his take comparing Black Lives Matter to the KKK, Whitlock said he preferred an email interview due to the \"sensitive topic.\"  \"The Ku Klux Klan was founded on Christmas Eve 1865 by Confederate soldiers dedicated to undermining the racial progress sparked by the Civil War and Emancipation Proclamation,\" Whitlock wrote.  Citing a History.com link, Whitlock talked of how it was at night when the KKK took part in terrorist raids against Blacks and white Republicans. He said they used intimidation, destroyed property, assaulted and killed in an effort to influence upcoming elections.  \"Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests have primarily terrorized and destroyed property in (B)lack communities at night,\" he wrote. \"BLM and Antifa have attempted to intimidate white Republicans. BLM protests have been violent and caused the assassination of law enforcement officers and other citizens.\"   Whitlock said he believes it is not a coincidence that \"Black Lives Matter riots pick up during an election cycle and disappear after the votes have been counted.\"   Richard Pierce, a professor and historian at the University of Notre Dame, called Whitlock's comments a \"provocative, inflammatory screed.\" Pierce, who studies twentieth century America and specializes in the urban experience of Blacks, told IndyStar he had no desire to break down point by point why Whitlock is wrong.  \"Nonetheless, I will say this. The KKK rioters commonly wore hoods to camouflage their identity and mimicked confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest's marauding practices honed during the Civil War,\" he said. \"Their very anonymity added to their intimidation.\"   Black Lives Matter events, by contrast, are permitted events which take place under the protection of the First Amendment, he said.   \"Protesters, prior to COVID-19 safeguard measures, were mostly unmasked,\" he said. \"I've never seen a hooded Black Lives Matter protester.\"  Pierce added that Black Lives Matter protest marches correlate more strongly with events of inequality rather than the public election cycle.  Whitlock says his analogy comparing the KKK and Black Lives Matter is not far-fetched, nor is it hard to comprehend, \"particularly for the mainstream media.\"  \"My analogy is far more substantive and accurate than pretending the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6 were an armed insurrection analogous to Pearl Harbor and 9/11,\" he said. \"Black Lives Matter, founded by self-described trained Marxists, has a stated goal of disrupting Western Civilization traditions and values.\"    Whitlock, in the past several years, has been entering more and more into the fray of politics.  In October, he had a sit-down interview with then-President Donald Trump at the White House, who asked him for advice in an upcoming presidential debate.  The interview aired on Outkick.com, a newly launched website that features Whitlock and Clay Travis, host of Fox Sports radio, and focuses on politics and sports.  Whitlock left Fox Sports in June, where he co-hosted “Speak for Yourself\" on FS1 for four years alongside Marcellus Wiley. Before that, the Warren Central and Ball State graduate worked for ESPN.   Whitlock stirred controversy in 2018 when he said that in the immediate aftermath of the civil rights movement in the 1960s, the Democrats marketed liberalism as the solution to Black people’s problems.  “And liberalism now is like a cigarette. It’s been marketed to us the same as the cigarette — fashionable, sophisticated,” he said. “It’s supposed to be liberating but I think it needs a surgeon general’s warning: Hazardous to your families and all the values you were taught as a child.”  Whitlock said 95% of Blacks “are afraid to even admit that we have conservative values.”  IndyStar has reached out to Black Lives Matter for comment.   Follow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on Twitter: @DanaBenbow.

U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan ruled that the policy which banned political speech violated employees’ rights to free speech and equal protection   The Port Authority argued that the policy was necessary to prevent disruption among employees or with customers.   A spokesman for the authority declined to comment on the ruling.   The decision also enjoins Port Authority officials from enforcing its ban on Black Lives Matter masks and shall rescind any displine actions issued to any employees for wearing one of the masks.   Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of the police and ensuing nationwide protests, many of the Port Authority’s 1,700 drivers and other employees began to wear Black Lives Matters masks, according to our partners at the Trib.  TRENDING NOW:   In July, after one employee complained and asked what would happen if he wore a “White Lives Matter” mask, Port Authority implemented a new policy. It stated “Buttons, stickers, jewelry and clothing (including masks or other face coverings) of a political or social protest nature are not permitted to be worn.”   Several weeks later, following additional protests of the agency, Port Authority implemented an even more restrictive policy — allowing employees to wear one of only four approved types of masks: one with the Port Authority logo; the union logo; solid blue or black; or a surgical N-95 mask.   On Sept. 30, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 85, along with several employees, filed a federal lawsuit against Port Authority, arguing that the ban on Black Lives Matter masks was a violation of their free speech and equal protection rights.   The lawsuit sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting the authority from enforcing the mask ban.   © 2021 Cox Media Group    © 2021 Cox Media Group.

Prof Richard Oreffo had the idea of setting up the fund three years ago but \"knew no-one would entertain the idea\".  After black rights protests led to social media campaigns he decided to set up the fund to achieve real change.  Prof Oreffo credits his academic success to the support he received from his primary school in Bristol.  He moved to the city in 1969 at the age of eight and attended Westbury Park Primary, where the head teacher Mr Gutsell, \"took my brother and myself under his wing\".   \"He enthused me for education and he just changed my life,\" Prof Oreffo said.  The Cowrie Scholarship Foundation aims to fund 100 undergraduate places by asking universities and businesses to commit to paying tuition fees for three students at a time.  Newcastle University was the first to pledge funds and York University has doubled its commitment and will pay for six students' tuition fees.  \"It was troubling times in the 70s and 80s to be black and mixed race.  \"The catalyst for setting up the foundation was the tragic death of George Floyd,\" said Prof Oreffo, who teaches Musculoskeletal Science at the University of Southampton.  \"I wanted to make a difference and this was the opportunity.\"  Prof Oreffo was born in London in 1961 and his family moved to Nigeria when he was 12 months old.  His parents then relocated to Bristol, leaving the children behind, to take up his father's scholarship at the University of Bristol.  Soon afterwards the civil war broke out and the twins became refugees for nearly three years.  In December 1969 the Red Cross flew the siblings to the UK.  \"It was a huge change in the environment, the ability to have almost anything you wanted, heat, light, food, compared to fleeing a war zone,\" said Prof Oreffo.  To date the fund has raised enough money to support 33 students studying in a Russell Group university, the first of whom will start in September.  He said: \"Nelson Mandela said education was the powerful weapon you can use to change the world and that is so true.\"   \"Because of what happened to me, because of the foundation from Westbury Park Primary School, I was fortunate enough to go to Liverpool University and gain two doctorates from Oxford University.  \"I'm doing what I love which is bone repair and how to repair our bones in an ageing population.\"  Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Leaders said over and over again: This is a movement, not a moment.  Months removed from the height of nationwide protests, the movement has arrived at a critical point, where leaders are focusing on how they transition beyond the demonstrations and hashtags.  It’s a new year, a new presidency and a fresh start.  “Now we’re staring at a point where we’re trying to recover. Hopefully that emotion, that passion, that anger that exist in the community will now take on a mantra of rebuilding and restoring,” said Irving Joyner, a law professor at North Carolina Central University.  He said the time is now more than ever to create a strategy.  “Black Lives Matter definitely allowed us to put on the center of the conversation in public discourse the problem of mass incarceration, police brutality and the deep inequities that continue to persist,” added Dr. Johnny Hill, dean of the Divinity School at Shaw University.  Hill said the impact is huge. It is now putting young people, like Greear Webb, at student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, on the front lines of history.  “Not only can we protest and raise our voices for what’s right, but we have ideas that should be implemented that move our nation to a more better and more equitable future,” said Webb.  “It seems like we sound the alarm and then the issue goes away. We have to make things personal. And I like to say that true change takes three parts. The first is education, the second is protest, and the third is policy change,” he added.  Policy changes are already beginning locally in the fight against racial injustice. For example, Durham is passing a law to ban race-related hair discrimination in the workplace and in schools.  Among those who marched in 2020, there is a renewed hope for 2021.  “Unity does not come without accountability. So I would say that I’m cautiously optimistic,” Webb said.  Joyner and Hill also agreed a crucial measure of this movement now is to continue focusing on its goal, making sure the narrative to fight for racial justice remains.

Adams, a senior who is one of the most decorated basketball players in the school district's history, spoke at Wednesday's school board meeting, emphasizing that to her, the sole issue is about bringing awareness to the lack of equality and the struggles of the Black community.   \"To me, Black Lives Matter has nothing to do with the police,\" Adams said. \"I have nothing against the police. It's just that our lives cannot and will not matter until Black lives do.\"   Board President Ken Pate, speaking on behalf of the board, said the issue is that the basketball team and Adams represent the school when they set foot on the court.   \"We as a Board of Education are elected to represent the whole school,\" Pate said. \"And our uniforms have to be uniform, that's the whole thing. So we're going to ask that the uniforms have the school name and the student's name if they choose, and nothing else.\"  The warmup shirts are paid for individually by the team members, not by the school district. Most seasons, the basketball gym would be packed with fans eager to see Adams and her Hawks teammates getting ready for their games. But due to the coronavirus pandemic, the gyms will be empty except for the teams, coaches and game officials, so fans will see what the players are wearing.   The New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, which oversees high school sports in the state, said schools are required to adhere to National Federation of High Schools uniform rules, which apply to the actual uniforms worn on the court during the game, an NJSIAA spokesman said. Pregame uniforms and activities are under the discretion of member schools.  The Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum during the summer, amid marches and demonstrations in the wake of the death of George Floyd, who died while a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. But the Black Lives Matter movement became controversial as riots broke out in some cities.   UPDATE: New Jersey has released the list that shows, in order, when you can get the COVID-19 vaccine and where. Here's what you should know.  Players in the WNBA began wearing warmups emblazoned with Black Lives Matter for their pregame shootarounds, and that action spread to the NBA and other sports as well.   UPDATE: New Jersey has released the list that shows, in order, when you can get the COVID-19 vaccine and where. Here's what you should know.  Patch reached out Thursday afternoon to Lisa Adams, Destiny's mother, who said her daughter was very disheartened by the response she received from the school board.   \"She felt the board didn't really listen to what she was saying,\" Lisa Adams said. \"They didn't suggest any alternative, they didn't have a discussion. It was clear they had already made a decision.\"  Lisa Adams said the warmup shirts are designed annually by the team's seniors. Destiny was inspired by the events of the summer and wanted to bring awareness. She saw a plain shirt with just the words Black Lives Matter on Amazon and shared it with her teammates, and a few bought them.   \"We didn't realize she had sent it to the team,\" Lisa Adams said.   When the team's coaches learned about the shirt, they suggested that the saying be put on the sleeve for the players who wanted it, Lisa Adams said. A team meeting was held, and she said there seemed to be agreement, but she said the athletic director, Keith Lister, and Superintendent David Trethaway were notified. At that point, Destiny was told the school board would have to weigh in.   \"This movement means so much to me personally as a Black woman in America,\" the 17-year-old told the board Wednesday. \"As we all should know, the Black community is not treated equally in this country. From our country's origin, the Black population has been silenced and pushed aside. I refuse to be silenced because I believe awareness should be brought to this movement.\"  Destiny Adams, who is headed to the University of North Carolina in the fall, has helped put Manchester girls basketball on the map. She was named to the first-team All-State in 2020 as a junior and to second-team All-State as a sophomore. The Hawks won the Shore Conference Tournament and the NJSIAA Group 2 title her sophomore year, and have won three straight NJSIAA South Jersey Group 2 titles, along with divisional crowns. Adams has 1,560 points in three years and hopes to break the school's scoring record this year.   She said her status in basketball circles makes her want to inspire younger children to know they can stand up for themselves.  \"Plenty of little girls look up to me,\" she said. \"If they see me on social media or in the gym with this saying on my back, it will teach them to stand up for what's right and always let their voices be heard.\"  \"Being able to wear this saying on my shirt will make me feel like I am starting to make the change I want to see in America,\" she said.   \"Those words to Destiny are incredibly important as she believes, as we all should, that Black lives matter, and it is her desire to bring awareness to that plain fact,\" Lisa Adams told the school board Wednesday night. \"She does not support anti-police beliefs, she does not promote violence, she does not support vandalism or looting.\"  \"She is passionate about basketball, and she is passionate about this. She wants them to go hand in hand,\" Lisa Adams told the board.   Pate praised Destiny Adams for speaking to the board.   \"It takes a lot of courage to do what you just did,\" Pate said. \"When I was your age, I don't know that I could have done that, I really don't.\"  \"I really and truly believe it when you say you don't mean it to be divisive, and that you truly believe in your passion,\" he said. \"Change has to come. And our country is starting toward that. But this is a school function, it represents the whole school. When you come out on the court, you're representing the whole school, and we feel it needs to have the school name and the student's name only at this point.\"  \"That's what we've discussed, that's what we feel it should be,\" he said. \"Destiny, please do not give up your passion. Please do not, that is not our intent whatsoever.\"  On Thursday, Lisa Adams said Destiny was upset by the feeling that the school does not support her in what she feels is so important and is not sure what she might do.  \"Basketball is her pulpit,\" Lisa Adams said. \"She has fans. She has followers, She is an influencer. She is an example. She wants to educate. She wants individuals to hear her supporting this movement.\"  This article has been updated with information on the NJSIAA's uniform rules.

An overhaul of the Independent Police Oversight Board, or IPOB, was one of the main recommendations addressed in a Turner-commissioned policing reform task force, which published findings of its review in September.  Since then, community activists have called on Turner to begin implementing many of the policy recommendations. But many allege Turner isn’t moving quickly enough and hasn’t kept the public in the know about what’s underway.  On Thursday, Turner said that was not the case.  “We are working internally to restructure that. It will be restructured,” Turner said, referring to the embattled IPOB, which was long referred to as a ‘toothless tiger’ by activists that said the board is far too aligned with the interests of the Houston Police Department.  “There will be more people added to IPOB/Civilian Review Board.  In addition, we’re putting in place something like an Office of Inspector General, along with a staffing person,” Turner continued, adding complaints reviewed, “won’t just come internally they can come from the public and the Office of Inspector General will have the responsibility of investigating and working in conjunction with the civilian review board.”   But Thursday marked 113 days since Turner’s task force unveiled its policy recommendations – 104 total – which includes increased training for officers to respond to mental health crises, changes to the disciplinary process for officers accused of wrongdoing, increased focus on community policing, among other suggestions.  Turner said he expected changes to IPOB to be introduced in the coming months, but said a solid date has not been set. That’s drawn criticism from community activists who accuse the mayor of dragging his feet.  “My thought process is that we’re stagnated,” said Ashton P. Woods of Black Lives Matter Houston.   Woods, along with other community activists, have said they’ve worked for years to see some of the reform policies come into fruition and argues change can begin now.  “Many of the recommendations from this advisory council, much like others, looks like it’s collecting dust on the shelf,” Woods said.  Mayor Turner denied that allegation and cited other reform measures already implemented that have made a difference.  “As you know, I signed the Executive Order and made it an obligation for, say, police officers who see other police officers doing something wrong, they are required to intervene,” he said.   Turner said the city also provided additional funding to the Crisis Intervention Response Teams (CIRT), specifically for domestic violence.  Turner added the city’s IT department is also working on developing a dashboard for reporting cases of police brutality. Moreover, Cite and Release and Safe Harbor Court have been implemented.  “We’re approaching things from multiple levels,” Turner said.  But the push for policing reform also came with a call for transparency – including throughout the reform process.  Woods said thus far the activist community has been kept out of the conversation, despite helping to design many of the recommendations.  “He gave an affirmative to how he would handle that. We’ve seen no action. We’ve no meetings. No invitations. Nothing,” Woods argued.  Houston’s IPOB is ‘one of the least effective in the state,’ according to a recent report.   The report, released last November by Rice University’s Kinder Institute, concluded Houston’s police oversight board was among the least effective in Texas. It  reported the panel suffers “from a lack of data access, a lack of independence, uncertain legal status, and a complete lack of transparency and public reporting.”  The report also shined a light on how complicated reforming the disciplinary process can be.  It would involve changes to state law, particularly Local Government Code 143.   “We suggest that state and city officials confer to discuss LGC 143′s barriers to effective oversight, as outlined by NACOLE’s principles, and encourage more uniform and evidence-based policy design,” the report’s researchers wrote.  Critics long have called the panel a toothless tiger for what they say it doesn’t have: subpoena power.  The mayor’s task force concluded the panel required independent access to information and evidence, rather than what is received from HPD investigations.  But along with potential changes to state law, reform of the disciplinary process also would require changes to the city’s labor contract with the Houston Police Officers Union or HPOU.  Doug Griffith, president of the Houston Police Officers Union, said the union supports most of the recommendations made by the mayor’s task force.  “I think there’s plenty that can be implemented, especially in the way of training.  Our officers would love more training. They beg for more training. The problem is it comes to funding,” Griffith said.  Griffith said the officer-involved shooting death of Nicholas Chavez, last April, speaks the need for more training.  Officers fired 24 rounds fired after Chavez, seen in cell phone video on his knees, gestured toward what officers on the ground said was a taser, although its cartridge was empty.  The city fired four officers involved, calling the shooting death unjustified.  HPOU maintains Chavez’s death was “terrible” but maintains officers acted in accordance with the active shooter training they received.  The union has decried the firing, instead of placing blame on a lack of training when dealing with mental health calls.  “They reacted differently, each of them did. The sergeant acted completely appropriately. He went with his training. He set up the guys just like they were doing an active shooter. You know why? That’s the extent of our training. He lined his officers up just like they were going to deal with an active shooter. The problem is they were unaware the taser cartridges had been spent and nobody told them,” Griffith said.  Overall, Griffith said the current disciplinary process is extensive and fair to all sides.  “I believe it’s a very fair process that they have in place. They do a phenomenal job in terms of feeling out the investigations and making sure they’re properly done,” Griffith said, adding he doesn’t think the addition of subpoena power would make much of a difference in strengthening IPOB’s authority.  “This group is to provide a framework for a fair discipline process. They make sure the investigation is done properly and if it’s not they can send it back and have it reviewed and changed.”  Community activists: current structure leaves zero room for an independent investigation.   Woods maintains part of the challenge in pushing for policing reform is a very strong police union.  “HPOU has active members on the police advisory board. So, there already was a problem with that, and while I’m big on supporting unions, police officer unions, in particular, are very powerful in ways they should not be,” Woods said.  Woods argued the union has slowed down the reform process, a claim the union denies. Moreover, while the union wields power, Woods said Mayor Turner does, as well. He said Turner should propose changes to disciplinary guidelines during the union’s collective bargaining process.  “When you think about how things work, and you talk to people about who does what, you have to understand accessibility is one of those things that make a difference,” Woods said.  The current HPOU contract was set to expire on Dec. 31.  However, it’s still in place, under what’s called an evergreen phase.  “We have an evergreen clause, so we’re staying with the evergreen clause all the way until December 2021,” HPOU’s Doug Griffith said.  If we don’t come to an agreement at that point, we’re just status quo – no raises, no changes in the contract until we sit down and meet again.”   While that’s true, talks could begin at any point before December 2021.  Mayor Turner said revising disciplinary guidelines during collective bargaining is complicated and can be tricky. Still, community activists maintain doing so is the right thing to do.  “The reality is that we need people in leadership who are unafraid to stand up to people who even donate to them and endorse them,” Woods said.

That is now commonly recognized as the first law to establish religious freedom, and was one of three achievements that its author, Thomas Jefferson, had inscribed on his tombstone. That date has been officially recognized as Religious Freedom Day since 1993, and amid so much political tumult, it went almost overlooked this year. But it goes to the core of what America is all about, what Trump's supporters are trying to destroy, and what Black Lives Matter demonstrators so emphatically affirmed this past year.   Jefferson's statute provided unlimited freedom of conscience for all — a pluralistic paradise. But ever since Barack Obama's election in 2008, the religious right has seized on Religious Freedom Day as a key part of its Orwellian propaganda campaign to redefine religious freedom as a license to discriminate, an exclusionary license for religious bigotry and sectarian dominance — the exact opposite of what Jefferson fundamentally believed in. So it's only natural that both Jefferson and the Virginia Statute are almost entirely absent from any of the right's gaslighting celebrations of religious freedom.   Since 2016 (as I've reported), a growing chorus of religious and secular progressives — organized in part by people like Frederick Clarkson, senior research analyst at Political Research Associates — have pushed back, seeking reclaim Jefferson's original intent, which he later made explicit, writing that the Statute contained \"within the mantle of its protection, the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and Mohametan, the Hindoo and Infidel of every denomination.\" Recovering the original meaning also entails pushing back against the right's anti-choice and anti-LGBTQ politics, which they've sought to protect under the mantle of their own beliefs, while forcing those beliefs on others.   Of course, Jefferson has come in for increasing criticism from the left as well, due to his slaveholder status, which looms larger than ever after last year's historic Black Lives Matters protests. But rather than argue over Jefferson's undeniable individual flaws, there's a growing movement in the Black religious community to adopt a much broader and deeper critical view of the discourse of religious freedom, even if it was initially promulgated by a slave-owning empire. These new voices are more in synch than at odds with those previously engaged in the battle to reclaim religious freedom, as seen in a roundtable forum produced by Political Research Associates, \"Religious Freedom and the Machinations of the Christian Right,\" held on Jan. 14.   Two days earlier, the shared perspective among Black Christians and non-Christians was richly explored in Freedom Forum's book launch and webinar, \"African Americans & Religious Freedom: New Perspectives for Congregations & Communities.\" Black people in the Americas, enslaved with a set of Christian justifications \"and displaced from their lands, culture, religions and ancestors, have a unique and fierce historical commitment to the ideals of freedom,\" Baptist theologian Faith B. Harris writes in the first chapter of the book (pdf here). \"With their very presence, New World Africans have a unique claim to religious freedom, despite the rhetoric embedded in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\"   As the New York Times' 1619 Project reminds us, this presence predates Jefferson's statute by more than a century and a half. Harris continues: \"Indeed, Black religion is best expressed by an enduring relationship to a freedom-loving/giving God. Theologian Kelly Brown Douglas argues that in the Black theological imagination, God is free and to be in a relationship with God is to be free.\"  The Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., raises provocative questions about the very language involved. \"The concept of religious freedom strikes me as another rhetorical arrow in the quiver of nationalistic propaganda,\" he writes. \"I am not moved by a nation that trumpets liberty while exterminating First Nations people, brutally enslaving and extracting labor from Africans and crushing the poor masses by hocking the universal benefits of capitalism.\"    From the beginning of European colonization in North America, Vanderbilt theologian Teresa L. Smallwood notes, \"It was the twin discourses of race and religion which shaped the discourse of religious freedom. … The organizing principle of British colonial societies followed a religious logic and privileged landholding white men. These religious men acted brutally and used the labor of enslaved Africans to generate considerable wealth.\" In contrast, she notes, \"Whatever the convention — Protestant, Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, non-denominational, Indigenous —African Americans exercised religious freedom largely as a means of resistance and in the face of prolonged tyranny.\"  This larger perspective — grounded in the basic material experience of slavery, resistance and continued struggled — puts the focus on deeds more than words, and on practices, institutions and history more than disembodied arguments, be they theological, philosophical, judicial or political. A key text cited by several contributors was Tisa Wenger's 2017 book \"Religious Freedom: The Contested History of an American Ideal.\" Wenger explained:  Rather than asking how adequately Americans have achieved this freedom or how rapidly it advanced, I wanted to know who appealed to religious freedom, for what purposes, and what it meant to them. Somewhat unexpectedly, race and empire quickly emerged as key themes in my analysis. I found that some of the most frequent and visible articulations of American religious freedom were exclusive, even coercive. The dominant voices in the culture linked racial whiteness, Protestant Christianity, and American national identity not only to freedom in general but often to this freedom in particular. The most audible varieties of religious freedom talk ... helped define American whiteness and make the case for U.S. imperial rule.  But in response, the racialized and colonialized subjects of U.S. empire also rearticulated this freedom to defend themselves and their traditions. For them, religious freedom became a way to redefine communal identities, to carve out space for themselves and their traditions within the confines of a racialized empire, and even to resist its mandates.  Her book focuses on the period from the Spanish-American War of 1898 to World War II, \"a pivotal period in our histories of race and empire but one that most scholarship on religious freedom has neglected,\" she explains. Much the same sorts of observations can be applied all the way from the colonial era to the present. And her perspective frames both the embrace of and skepticism toward the idea of religious freedom.   \"There has always been just enough religious freedom in America for Black folk to nourish dreams of freedom, but hardly ever enough religious freedom for those dreams to be fully realized,\" writes Lamar. \"This conundrum is, in essence, the foundation upon which my reluctant identification with the ideal of religious freedom rests — who has unimpeachable, unassailable religious freedom in America? Wenger reminds us that for Native Americans and Black nationalists it was curtailed. Who then can take this American ideal and use it to craft theological visions unmolested by imperial power? Can Black churches ever fully enjoy this ideal?\"  On the other hand, Rahmah A. Abdulaleem, executive director of KARAMAH: Muslim Women Lawyers for Human Rights, sees a stronger underlying foundation in the lived reality of African-American life — the religious diversity and pluralism she traces back to colonial times in her book chapter, \"Race, Religious Pluralism and Religious Freedom,\" which she brought up to date in her forum presentation.   \"I think it's important to focus on the fact that after 9/11 so many Americans were asked, 'Do you know any Muslims?' and most African-Americans could say, 'Yeah, I know Muslims. I grew up with them. They're in in my family.' We weren't others,\" she said. \"So African Americans really need to focus on the fact that we always welcome others. It's always been important to us because we know what's like to be in the minority. We know what it's like to be otherized.\"  She continued with a moving and important family example:  My grandmother was blessed with 11 children and she considers herself a Universalist but not as a Universalist for the Universalist Church. She's like, \"I'm universalist because my oldest daughter was a Buddhist, I have a daughter who is a deaconess in the Baptist Church, I have a son who's an imam, I have two sons that are Catholic.\" It's so important that for her they're all her children and they all are having some kind of connection to something bigger than them.  These important Black voices have not yet been woven into the heart of religious freedom debates. But the promise of their imminent inclusion is a cause for renewed hope. While the religious right feeds constantly on victimhood fantasies, the African-American experience — grounded in four centuries of actual victimhood — has produced a rich diversity of humane and sober religious responses, along with its own freethinking and atheist traditions as well.   Indeed, a fair amount of the discussion held by Political Research Associates intersected with perspectives and concerns raised in the Freedom Forum book and webinar. As Frederick Clarkson put it:  This profoundly liberatory thing we call religious freedom came out of this morass of racism and genocide and extraordinary criminality, that the very people who were opposing Empire colonialism effectively replaced domestically. So what they did do was to give us this extraordinary idea of religious freedom: \"OK, we still have an empire of sorts, but you are free to think differently than the people who hold power.\" You can therefore speak differently and you can have an oppositional press and you can organize politically differently. That was the opening, and they recognized that. But they realized their time as rulers might end, and should end. That is the extraordinary paradox of American culture and democracy that we actually still live through in many respects today.  \"When you talk about urgently needing to address religious freedom and decolonization,\" ex-evangelical writer Chrissy Stroop said, \"one thing that I think it's important to point out is how intertwined white supremacy is with white Christianity and particularly the white evangelical tradition. S, the same people who are trying to argue that religious freedom means their freedom to discriminate against other people in a Christian nation are the primary people who are fighting to maintain white supremacism, though many of them would not admit to that.\"  Stroop went on to cite the example of six seminaries within the Southern Baptist Convention, which \"recently issued a statement condemning critical race theory and intersectionality as incompatible with Baptist theology, incompatible with the Bible as the Southern Baptists understand it.\" Stroop noted that Southern Baptists formed in the 1840s, in a schism from Baptists in the North over whether a slaveholder could be a Christian missionary.   \"The Southern Baptist Convention has apologized for that legacy, and yet fails to fully reckon with it,\" Stroop said. \"This explicit rejection by the official Southern Baptist structures of antiracist scholarship and antiracist analytical tools is quite striking,\" particularly given what has recently transpired.   \"For someone like Albert Mohler — who is the head of the flagship Southern Baptist seminary — to come along and say after last Wednesday's insurrection that he's shocked that Christians would do this, that they would form a mob and storm the capital in support of the racist president, is really quite rich,\" Stroop remarked. \"He just basically made this very racist move, and now he's saying, 'I can't believe that people would actually take that to the streets [and] try to overturn an election.\"  Another participant, the Rev. Dr. Cari Jackson, director of spiritual care and activism at the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, has co-authored an article at Religion Dispatches with Clarkson, \"We Can't Have Religious Freedom Without Reproductive Freedom.\" She brought that connection into the discussion as well, with specific reference to the recent Senate election in Georgia election.   \"One of the issues that was raised by some regarding the Rev. Raphael Warnock [who took office this past week] was that he could not be a Christian minister and a supporter of reproductive freedom,\" Jackson said. To Warnock's opponents, it was as if \"he didn't have a right to have a conscience of his own that would embrace both of those, that in many ways he didn't have the right to be a whole person and bring his theology and his politics in this intersectional way that came out with a different result from what people thought he should have.\"   Individual conscience is supposed to be primary in the Baptist tradition — a fact that has somehow been utterly disappeared over the last 40 years. But Jackson reminded us that Baptists weren't alone in this regard:   Some of you may know there is a doctrine within Catholic teaching that says the primacy of conscience has greater weight than teachings of the church, and I love that. Martin Luther, who was one of the shapers of the Reformation, also talked about the importance of conscience, and that following behind the church hierarchy was not as critical in his own spiritual and religious understanding as following his conscience. So we're in this era now where people are being villainized if their understanding of their conscience does not align with someone else's. That is a supremacist orientation that really not only flies in the face of what it means to be a human living in dignity, it also flies in the face of what it means to be a democratic republic.  She went on to say that while some people are psychopaths or sociopaths, \"For most of us conscience leads us to a deep morality that is rooted in compassion and love. … Conscience, I believe for most of us, guides us to a higher nature that opens our hearts and our minds and our politics to way of being in society with one another that I think is really critical.\"  Another facet of the fight to reclaim religious freedom was highlighted in a virtual briefing on the recently-heard Supreme Court case, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia. As the ACLU succinctly explains it, \"On November 4, the Supreme Court heard a case that could allow private agencies that receive taxpayer-funding to provide government services — such as foster care providers, food banks, homeless shelters, and more — to deny services to people who are LGBTQ, Jewish, Muslim, or Mormon.\" This briefing was closed to the press, but the moderator, Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons, from the Faith & Progressive Policy Initiative at the Center for American Progress, spoke with Salon afterwards.  \"It's a common purpose across many faith groups we work with that we cherish religious freedom and want to celebrate Religious Freedom Day, and reject the false use of religious freedom to discriminate,\" Graves-Fitzsimmons said. \"We want to do both at the same time.\" He was admittedly one of the few people who woke up the day after the November election to listen to the oral arguments in the Fulton case. But millions of people stand to be affected. \"We are facing a challenge of raising awareness around this case, because there's so much going on and the Fulton case could have far-reaching implications beyond the particular circumstances in the case involving the City of Philadelphia and Catholic Social Services,\" he said. He explaind:   It is part of a larger trend we're seeing, which is conservative legal advocacy groups taking something that is a real core value, like religious freedom, and using it in a deceptive way to attack LGBTQ people and create a license to discriminate that extends beyond LGBTQ people — you have this foster care agency in South Carolina that's saying, \"We won't work with Catholics or Jews.\" So the license to discriminate is broader than LGBTQ people, although that's the issue in this case. It then extends to reproductive health and abortion rights, and we've seen recently at the Supreme Court the use of distorted religious freedom arguments as an excuse to spread the coronavirus. We saw a switch in the Supreme Court's views since Amy Coney Barrett joined the Supreme Court. They went in a different direction than what Justice Roberts and the more liberal justices had done earlier in the pandemic.   But if the Fulton case, and others like it, have gotten too little attention, that's even more true of religious freedom issues in the military, where long-standing Supreme Court doctrine subordinates religious expression to the military mission, which is to preserve freedom for all Americans. That in turn depends on maintaining unit cohesion, good order, morale and discipline — which religious proselytizing necessarily undermine. The Military Religious Freedom Foundation has been fighting Christian nationalism as a destructive force in the military for more than 15 years, warning that it is fundamentally incompatible with the military's mission.  Some branches of the military are better, some worse, at restraining this corrosive force. The Air Force Academy, where MRFF founder and president Mikey Weinstein graduated, is arguably the worst. One of its graduates, Larry Brock, was one of two insurrectionists wearing combat gear arrested in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol invasion.   \"The Air Force Academy is an unconstitutional train wreck of fundamentalist Christians, disgrace and shame,\" Weinstein told Salon. \"Everybody at the Air Force Academy, the cadet wing, the staff and the faculty, all swear an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, not the gospel of Jesus Christ.\" The failure to live up to that oath can be seen in the fact that MRFF still has \"hundreds of clients there, the vast majority of whom are Christians being persecuted by other Christians,\" Weinstein explained. \"For years we've had — we still have — cadets at the Academy pretending to be fundamentalist Christians,\" purely because \"they hope they'll be left alone.\"    in an open letter to the Air Force Academy, posted at Daily Kos, the MRFF wrote: \"We warned you that this radical, right-wing influence found not only at USAFA, but tolerated or even endorsed by senior officers throughout the Air Force, caused a toxic leadership environment and eroded unit cohesion, good order, morale, and discipline. We constantly worried and warned that these seemingly (to some) innocuous events would lead to embarrassment for our Air Force Academy or worse — and that's exactly what's happened.\" The letter goes on:   The MRFF now calls on the Air Force Academy to not only clearly and publicly condemn the actions of its graduate, Mr. Brock, in the harshest possible manner, but also to call on all other USAFA graduates who attended the insurrection to identify themselves and either turn themselves in to police if they broke the law or disavow the violence and storming of the Capitol — if they, themselves, behaved in an otherwise peaceful manner.  To further clarify, Weinstein told Salon, \"When you retire and accept a paycheck, you are still under the [Uniform] Military Code of Justice.\" Brock, like other ex-military insurrectionists, he argued, \"should be brought back into the Air Force and should face a general court martial. He should be visibly and aggressively punished for what he did, as should anyone else that is getting a retirement check.\"  This is only a small and selective slice of activities related to Religious Freedom Day. In PRA's roundtable, for example, author and journalist Kathryn Joyce discussed her 2019 New Republic article, \"The Man Behind the State Department's New 'Natural Law' Focus,\" illuminating how premodern Catholic teaching about natural law was used by Trump's State Department to delegitimize modern concepts of human rights — concepts that the U.S. government has played a crucial role in developing and promoting. Another roundtable participant, Minnesota State Sen. John Marty, has introduced a resolution honoring the true meaning of Religious Freedom Day.   In the Freedom Forum webinar, Charles Watson Jr., director of education at the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, gave a spirited articulation of the centrality of freedom, in a sense that takes nothing away from anybody else:  I always tell people, I don't want a Biblical noose around my neck, and I don't want God shackles around my feet. I have to be free to change my mind, if I get better information, and my faith has to be free.  And the only way for me to have that freedom is to be free to change my mind, think about God how I see fit to think about God, without government interference, and especially without somebody else that doesn't even care enough about me and my body to take up the mantel and fight for me.  This sense of freedom has Baptist roots that long predate Thomas Jefferson — and, as Jackson noted, has Catholic and Lutheran roots as well. But Jefferson's contribution was to enshrine that sensibility in law, protecting it as never before. Because Jefferson's vision is so central to the American project and its entire history, there are inevitable ramifications everywhere throughout our public life. And because the religious right has mounted such a sustained attack on his vision, seeking to turn it into a vampiric, soulless caricature of itself, there are countless battlefronts — large and small — on which Jefferson's vision must be defended and, of absolute necessity, enlarged.   Paul Rosenberg is a California-based writer/activist, senior editor for Random Lengths News, and a columnist for Al Jazeera English.

It was a Black Live Matter vigil, one that has been meeting twice a month at city hall to keep the movement's calls for change present in Muncie.   \"There are new names added all the time,\" Emily Wornell, a local resident and organizer of the gathering said. \"This is an issue that gets a lot of attention occasionally, but it happens all the time.\"  While the gathering on Wednesday was a change in scale from the massive thousand-person march seen in Muncie in June, the message remained the same.  Members of the group said it was important even on days like the day of the inauguration to remind the public of the need for social justice to address racism and inequality in communities.   Help the Star Press continue to provide reporting like this. Find our latest subscription options and special offers here.  \"This is just one part of making sure to remember that. If we don't remember it, we can't transform from it,\" Markie Oliver, a local resident, said. Oliver also said it went beyond just issues with police, extending to economics, education and healthcare as well.  The new administration on a federal level was a step in the right direction, but Oliver said that they still have to be held accountable to promises made during the campaign.  \"We also have to remind our local officials and our state officials that this is still important,\" Oliver said. \"This is part of that.\"   While the Black Lives Matter movement might have been getting less attention recently on a national level, that doesn't mean the thousands of people promoting change have given up on the ideals that were brought forward during massive social movements this previous summer.  During Wednesday's demonstration in downtown Muncie, cars driving by the small group honked in support of those standing out in the cold.  Wornell expected that the events might become larger again when the weather gets warmer, but there won't be the massive rallies seen in 2020 until there is another high-profile case that garners national attention.   ►JUNE 2020: Thousands of protesters march in Muncie to rally against police brutality  \"I do this so I don't become complacent,\" Wornell said. \"I get these lists together so I have to be thinking about it on a regular basis.\"  Wornell also said that even with a small group in a city the size of Muncie, there is still a strong purpose to holding the vigil.  \"Black and brown people are still killed at much higher rates by those who are supposed to protect them,\" Wornell said before reading the names out loud. The list was so long that after 30 minutes, they were only to those names starting with the letter D.   One prominent voice during the summer rallies and a continual voice for equality in the community has been Muncie's Human Rights Commission Executive Director Yvonne Thompson.  ►Opinion: Let's get uncomfortable  ►Racial justice discussions, some easier than others, continue  ►‘Really disappointed’: BSU Athletics responds to report of racism in men’s volleyball program  Thompson — who wasn't at Wednesday's demonstration — said that the public has not forgotten the call for change made over the summer by the BLM movement.   \"It's a change in thinking. It's a new consciousness giving people, all people, a chance to be heard seen and understood,\" Thompson told The Star Press. \"I think people want to do better. It's critical time for people to learn from each other.\"  Thompson agreed that a new administration on the federal level was an opportunity for changes to be made across the country.  \"People are asking what they can do to make a difference in our country, and I think a lot of people are taking that to heart,\" Thompson said.

A recent search of the USPTO database revealed that there are 77 pending or dead applications for trademarks that include the phrase “Black Lives Matter.” Since the murder of George Floyd in late May 2020, over 50 new applications were filed for marks such as “BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT,” “BLACK LIVES MATTER HAND SANITIZER,” and “BLACK LIVES MATTER MOSCATO.”  This wave of “Black Lives Matter”-related trademark applications in 2020 is remarkable, given the USPTO’s previously articulated position regarding the registrability of trademarks using the phrase. Specifically, in 2018, the USPTO rejected the six applications containing the phrase “Black Lives Matter” that were filed by the originators of the movement. Founded by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, three black women, #BlackLivesMatter was ignited in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman who fatally shot Trayvon Martin. Since 2013, #BlackLivesMatter (or sometimes referred to as “BLM”) has utilized its platform to address racism across the nation, and seeks to affirm black humanity, to acknowledge of the contributions made in society by black men and women, and recognize the resilience of the black community in the face of oppression.  Relying upon this history, the USPTO rejected the BLM founders’ the applications for three reasons. First, the USPTO determined that the “Black Lives Matter” a slogan or term that does not function as a trademark or indicate the source of applicant’s goods and/or services and to identify and distinguish them from others. Second, the phrase identifies an informational, social, political, religious, or similar kind of message that merely conveys support of, admiration for, or affiliation with the ideals conveyed by the message. Third, the phrase is not one the public would not perceive as source-identifying matter that identifies applicant alone as the source of the goods/services, but rather as an expression of support for anti-violence advocates and civil rights groups because potential consumers would simply access the publications and enlist or engage in applicant’s services because they want to support the cause that the slogan represents, not because they believe the slogan indicates the source of such goods and services. The USPTO gave no weight to the fact that the founders of the BLM movement lodged the application.  The USPTO’s position is not surprising given that the purpose of a trademark registration is to identify a source. Trademarks help consumers identify the goods and services they wish to purchase, and those they want to avoid. The function of trademark is to designate the source of a particular good or service and to protect the good will of merchant supplying that good or service. Whether a term or phrase functions as a trademark or service mark depends on how it would be perceived by the public. The USPTO has determined that the more frequently a phase is used, the less likely that the public will use it to identify a source. In fact, the USPTO’s standard practice is to reject applications seeking to register marks that are merely informational, based on the nature and the context of the mark’s use in the marketplace, consumers would perceive it as merely conveying general information about the goods or services or an informational message, and not as a means to identify and distinguish the applicant’s goods/services from those of others. See Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure section 1202.04. Specifically, the USPTO instructs the examiners reviewing trademark applications to reject those seeking to register “widely used messages” or otherwise, slogans, terms, and phrases used by various parties to convey ordinary or familiar concepts or sentiments, as well as social, political, religious, or similar informational messages that are in common use or are otherwise generally understood. See 1202.04(b).  The USPTO has recently rejected the first of Black Lives Matter applications that were filed in 2020. Like the applications filed by the BLM founders in 2018, the USPTO determined that the recently applied-for mark, “2020 BLACK LIVES MATTER,” fails to function as a trademark to indicate the source of the applicant’s goods and fails to identify and distinguish itself from other “Black Lives Matter” marks or the movement itself. However, a rejected application does not diminish the value and significance of the Black Lives Matter slogan or movement.

And after reviewing videos from the events of that day in Yorba Linda, five more demonstrators have been charged, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office also announced.  Tatiana Rita Turner, 40, was charged in September after the protest with one felony count of attempted murder with premeditation and deliberation, six felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, including one causing great bodily injury, one felony count of mayhem, and two felony counts of the use of pepper spray by a felon in connection with the Yorba Linda protest.  During that protest, Turner — described as a Black Lives Matter supporter — drove through a crowd of BLM marchers and counter-protesters who gathered to confront them. A man and woman had major injuries and were hospitalized.  On Wednesday, prosecutors revealed that one month before Turner’s action in Yorba Linda, she had also attacked two men at a Seal Beach protest.  In that protest, on Aug. 29, 2020, prosecutors say she used a four-foot rod to strike two men as they lay on the ground after being beaten by a group of protesters.  “The Seal Beach attack left one of the victims with injuries to his head so severe they required staples,” prosecutors said in a statement.  Turner will be charged with two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, including one causing great bodily injury for the Seal Beach attack. Prosecutors said the new complaint with more charges will be filed during Turner’s next court date on Feb. 18.  If convicted Turner, who has previous felony convictions of domestic violence and drug sales, faces up to seven years to life plus 26 years in state prison. Jail records show she is being held in lieu of $1 million bail.  The others charged after the Yorba Linda protest are:  “We support the right to peacefully protest, but these are not peaceful protests,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement.  “These are organized protests that encourage others to engage in civil disobedience and violence. We continue to review all surveillance footage to identify other suspects, regardless of what side of an issue they are on.”  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nCommunity Voice\n    The movement has never been just about Black lives.

But right before it told me “Water is life” and “Kindness is everything,” blue painter’s tape had been applied, and over the word “Black,” the word “All” was placed so the sign could tell me that “All Lives Matter.”  And there I stood, holding back tears. Frustrated. The slap of my son’s slippers against the asphalt faded away as the words rang loudly in my head: All Lives Matter.  For the first half of 2020, I stayed largely removed from the Black Lives Matter movement. As a Black woman, I understood why we were marching but stayed relatively quiet.  Then I watched the public execution of George Floyd. I saw, in that man, the possibility of my son being served the same injustice. I saw him calling for me as his last breath was stolen. What kind of parent am I, I thought, if I do not do everything I can to protect my son?  But I wondered, Do I even have to do anything? I live on Maui. The Kingdom of Hawaii was one of the few kingdoms that did not participate in the slave trade of our people. It served as a refuge for any runaway slave because, in these islands, the Black person has always been free.  We had an equal opportunity to learn the names of the winds, to plant kalo and to prove we could become kamaaina. Why, in this oasis, would I have to explain that Black Lives Matter means All Lives Matter?  The sign on Maui that inspired the author to write this Community Voice column.  Keisa Liu  Slavery may not have made its way into these islands, but covert racism certainly did. Micro-agressions like, “You speak well for a colored person!” We’ve been called the N-word by Maui community members to put us in our place.  I’ve been told that Black men are lazy and don’t understand the importance of culture and family. I’ve seen Confederate Flag bumper stickers on trucks driving down Piilani Highway.  These little bits of racism don’t amount to much on their own, but together they begin to paint the picture that our struggles are not just a Mainland problem. They are a part of our collective consciousness that we hardly ever notice.  As a Black advocate, my work isn’t about standing up against overtly racist, Confederate flag-waving patriots. Not on Maui. My work is to deconstruct the fallacies that have been used to view the Black community.  My work is to show everyone how the Black community has been fighting for the voiceless for hundreds of years. We, as the Black community, have inched our way to positions of power in order to change the social lens used to view the disenfranchised, the misunderstood, the exploited, subjugated, ignored and appropriated lives.  In America, that has been and still is, the reality of Black life. We look at the everyday injustices the Black community faces and use them as the basis for laws that protect every citizen.  The Black community knows what it is like to live in an environment where you have to steal to eat. So we fight for food accessibility.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., marches with a contingent from Hawaii during the historic Selma marches in 1965.  Courtesy  We know what it is like to get passed up on that job because our kink wouldn’t lay down straight. So we push for anti-discrimination laws.  We know what it’s like to fill our children’s cups with poisoned water because to the large corporations, our lives are worth less than profits. We push for laws that protect our water.  We know what it is like to be redlined out of every neighborhood except the one by the sewer plant. We push for safe, affordable housing.  We know what it is like to be sent to jail for not having enough money in our pocket. We push to decriminalize poverty.  Our name sounds too ethnic to buy a house, get a job, go to college, attain wealth. We push for equal economic opportunity.  We know almost every social injustice because we have lived it. We have spent years breaking down barriers and shattering glass ceilings in attempts to abolish them. Not just for us, but for everyone.  So when I walked past that sign, just a week before Martin Luther King Jr. Day, it was a reminder that, even in this little oasis, there is still work to be done.  When you hear us shout Black Lives Matter, know this movement isn’t just about protecting the Black life. Black Lives Matter is a social justice movement for every life. Black Lives Matter is All Lives Matter.  \nCommunity Voices aims to encourage broad discussion on many\n\t\t\t\ttopics of\n\t\t\t\tcommunity interest.

Discussion continues about where a town-supported Black Lives Matter banner might hang in Arlington.  The banner hung in front of Town Hall from June 8 to Sept. 30, partly in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last May. After many in town wanted to see it returned, Town Meeting discussed an article about the matter in December. An amended motion was adopted, 166-34, with 38 abstaining.  At its Jan. 4 meeting, Select Board unanimously agreed to keep discussing the banner. It received a Dec. 30 memo from Board Vice Chair Joe Curro Jr. and board member DeCourcey, which recommends:  No plan shaped yet  As Kamala Harris becomes vice president, how do we grow the number of women and women of color in political roles? We teach them young.  DeCourcey said, \"We haven't developed a plan. This is in response to discussions last summer and fall, and Town Meeting. It's not a proposal for a permanent banner at Town Hall; this is open for discussion.\"  As Kamala Harris becomes vice president, how do we grow the number of women and women of color in political roles? We teach them young.  Board member Len Diggins said: \"We need to determine how we use public property to hang banners. There's no reason to think we won't find ourselves in a similar position to where we were in September,\" when the BLM banner was taken down, and residents complained.   \"I have no confidence that we'd stick to a policy because the pressures will come back. I'm in favor of the first and third list items, and recommend doing something bold―such as hang it across a street―so that people really see it,\" he said  Mahon said, \"Until now, the only banners displayed at Town Hall announced Town Day (a community event) and a strawberry festival hosted by the high school music department. Town Hall shouldn't display a banner 12 months of the year.\"  Hurd recommends hanging the banner to show that Arlington affirms that Black Lives Matter.  \"We've had many discussions on this and lots of public input,\" he said. \"Last fall, it came time to come up with a permanent plan for the banner in response to public input. We decided to go through our Special Town Meeting, and let the members weigh in on the subject.  \"I would consider that vote among other competing considerations. It's incumbent upon us now to come up with a plan. We've received enough input that we can come to a consensus to take action and have some sort of permanent plan to push for the statement of Black Lives Matter. We need to resolve this and move forward. Perhaps hang on flag pole at Uncle Sam Plaza.\"  Calyx Peak asks again for marijuana spot   The Select Board unanimously approved receipt of a presentation by marijuana retailer Calyx Peak, which seeks to open a retail store at 25 Summer St. Arlington has one remaining host agreement/permit available for a marijuana retailer.   Last year, several offers were presented to the Select Board, including Calyx Peak, which the Select Board did not approve in October. Read about this here >>   \"Since then, Calyx Peak has done community outreach, and want to present what, if any, progress they've made,\" Hurd said.  In a memo to the board, Calyx Peak Chief Executive Officer Ed Schmults wrote that in response to previous board comments, \"Calyx Peak engaged with a traffic engineering firm to study . . . traffic concerns . . . and began to reach out to the community for their feedback. Calyx Peak believes these steps were critical to address feedback from the Select Board and to properly address any impacts to the community.\"  Mahon said, \"I'm not inclined to have a mini-host community agreement meeting after we've already made a decision. This process sets a precedent that when we take a vote that does not get approved, it could be a way to circumvent the process.  \"The host community agreement is not open now; when it's open, that's when Calyx Peak should present more in-depth information. There are other issues than just traffic queuing.   \"I encourage all applicants to whom we didn't grant a license to wait until the board opens the application and everyone follows the same process, and not approve or consider this back-door approach.\"  Town Counsel Doug Heim and Mahon have been asked to clarify the process going forward.  Board to name police study panel member  The board unanimously agreed to designate a Select Board member to the town's Police Civilian Advisory Board Study Committee.  This vote allows for a designee, not an appointment, clarified Town Counsel Heim.  \"The designee would be an administrative person who would schedule the first meeting, concurrent with past practice, and we designate [Select Board Administrator] Marie Krepelka. Voting members will subsequently vote for each other. Either Krepelka or someone from the Select Board will continue on, with no voting oversight after the first meeting,\" explained .Mahon.   Youth art banners in Center this spring  This April and May, look for colorful banners hanging in the Center along Mass. Ave. Sponsored by the Arlington Commission for Arts and Culture, the Youth Banner Initiative, as it has since 2016, will display teen student artwork expressing the theme \"protest,\" as unanimously approved by the Select Board.  The banners were initially scheduled to hang through June, but board members were more comfortable with an April 1-to-May 31 time frame.  \"I'm concerned about the month of June, which celebrates Pride Month and (potentially) Arlington High School graduation,\" said Board member Steve DeCourcey.

(WLNE)- The flying of a Black Lives Matter flag on the Barrington town flagpole is stirring up controversy around the state.  Rhode Island’s United Veterans Council (UVC) has been fighting to have the flag removed from the flagpole since September. They argue that the movement has to do with politics and it should be kept off of the town’s flagpole.  Paul Dulchinos, retired Lieutenant Colonel and UVC president says, “This isn’t about whether black lives matter, of course they do. But BLM is a political movement. It is a partisan political flag.”  The UVC’s “Keep Politics off the Pole” campaign has been unsuccessful so far.  “We have been working within channels to ask our town government to recognize that it is divisive to fly a partisan flag. If they were flying a Confederate flag the flagpole would be torn down by now,” Dulchinos continued.  The Rhode Island Council of Israel (RICI) is joining the campaign to have the flag removed.  Founding board member, Luann Pezzullo gave her views on the flag, “The Black Lives Matter movement incites Jew-hatred. It promotes the blood libel that Israel is responsible for American police brutality against minorities.”  The organization is heavily involved in the fight against anti-Semitism.  “It (the flag) says that the Jewish people oppress people of color. Flying their flag is an attack on the the Jewish people,” continued Pezzullo.  Dulchinos says, “We don’t want the flag pole to become a political advertising tool for whatever feel good cause de jour at the whim of the Town Council or Town Manager.”  The town council will be holding a public hearing about the flag controversy on February 1, 2021.\t  Sign up for our Breaking News email alerts!  © 2021 ABC6.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  This website is using a security service to protect itself from online attacks.  \nCloudflare Ray ID: 61639dab5dc94c4a\n•\nYour IP: 2a02:908:674:f700:a929:f144:d1d9:6965\n•\nPerformance & security by Cloudflare\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  To revisit this article, select My⁠ ⁠Account, then View saved stories.

By Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor  Joe Biden may have been calculated in his efforts to project calm and stability in the waning weeks of the campaign, but the soothing influence of the incoming Biden Administration has been decisively undercut by the post-election stunts of Donald Trump, which erupted, on January 6th, into an open insurrection. As the U.S. remains mired in the coronavirus pandemic, the debates over the provision of health care and housing have become even more intense, if not desperate. Just as fraught are the unresolved questions concerning the grip of racism. Despite all of the platitudes and pledges to end “systemic racism,” its stain on the country has never been more apparent. African-Americans continue to be hospitalized for COVID-19 at nearly four times the rate of white people. Black unemployment, which is at nearly ten per cent, remains several points higher than the national rate. According to National Geographic, of the twenty-five U.S. counties with the highest projected food-insecurity rates, only four are majority white, and all of those are in Kentucky.  The political fault lines are not just between Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, for the former, the anxiety about the election’s outcome was not limited solely to fears of what four more years of Trump could produce. Progressives were just as worried that a Biden Administration would squander the opportunity to pursue transformative reforms that the U.S. overwhelmingly needs. For all of Biden’s testimony that he feels the pain of the public, those on the suffering end of the pandemic and the unemployment crisis are not in the mood for honeymoon hopefulness. They want action and results. But translating political desires into political action is a tall order. The dysfunction of the American state is part of what has compelled such passionate and prolonged political protest. Into this hectic fray, Alicia Garza, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network and the originator of the generational slogan, has launched an extraordinarily well-timed book, “The Purpose of Power: How We Come Together When We Fall Apart.”  Garza has been an organizer for more than twenty years, and the book is largely drawn from her experiences in a multitude of grassroots struggles. Born in Oakland in 1981, Garza has spent most of her life in Northern California. She was already active in campaigns against gentrification and police brutality when Oscar Grant III was killed by the Bay Area Rapid Transit police, on New Year’s Day in 2009, just blocks from her home. It was only weeks before Barack Obama became the country’s first Black President and more than two years after Ron Dellums, a Black democratic socialist, was elected mayor of Oakland. There was so much expectation that life would be different with these elected Black leaders, and then so much disappointment as murders by police pointed to more of the same. When George Zimmerman was acquitted, in July, 2013, of the murder of Trayvon Martin, Garza writes, “I cried for who we are, who America is, that we could let a child be murdered by an adult and let that adult get away with it.” Zimmerman’s acquittal and the parlous standing of Black American life that it signified prompted Garza to post an elemental declaration on Facebook: “Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.”  Garza’s book is not centrally about Black Lives Matter, the global network and organization, nor is it about the movement that has taken on this phrase as its central slogan. In part, that reflects still palpable tensions over the origins and authors of the movement, over who is credited and who is left out. Garza rightfully demands recognition for the roles played by herself, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi in connecting activists around the country and drawing international awareness to the crisis of racist police violence in the United States, but her goals extend beyond the struggle against police brutality or even the criminal-justice system. She is primarily interested in the larger question of how to move from engaging in protests and mobilization to acquiring the political power necessary to transform the conditions in poor and working-class Black communities. For Garza, this is bigger than Black Lives Matter: really, it is a demand for a different kind of society. “What if our leaders were as afraid to disappoint Black people as they were afraid to disappoint lobbyists, banks, and other corporate actors?” she writes. “When we declare that our future is Black, what we mean is that addressing the needs, concerns, hopes, and aspirations of Black people will bring about a better future for all of us.”  For Garza, achieving this kind of social reorganization and redistribution begins with an understanding of how the deep inequities that strangle our society came to be. Early in the book, she offers a surprising discussion about the rise of the conservative right and its political consolidation during the successive terms of Ronald Reagan. This is critical context for those who compare the current iteration of Black struggle to the civil-rights movement. Even in the fury of the rebellions of the nineteen-sixties, Black rebels had a glimmer of optimism, seeing their struggles as part of a global uprising for justice and democracy. The response of Democratic Party officials to every outbreak of violence—bearing new programs and opening new veins of spending—connected activism and revolt to tangible change in people’s lives. Garza’s account of the consequences of Reaganism makes clear that the Black Lives Matter generation came of age in the rubble of the civil-rights era, with the retrenching politics and policies rooted in Reaganism but readily inherited by a Democratic Party all too willing to do the bidding of the right. As Garza recalls, Bill Clinton signed two landmark pieces of legislation—the crime bill of 1994 and welfare reform in 1996—that “identified Black people as a threat to the American way of life.” The further we got from the era of Black rebellion in the sixties, the more comfortable politicians from both parties, including Black officials, became with blaming Black communities for the conditions of inequality that existed within them. This tendency bred cynicism and disconnection. Garza writes, “Movements shape us, and we shape them—sometimes consciously, other times unconsciously. My generation was and is still being shaped by the conservative consensus and the right’s rise to power.” The poet Reginald Dwayne Betts has described this generational cohort as the “Bastards of the Reagan Era.”  These conservative politics have hemmed in the horizons of both activists and ordinary people. The Democratic Party’s acquiescence to the narrow world view of the right resulted in progressive movements’ thinking small and organizing in sometimes inconsequential ways. Garza goes to some lengths to describe these phenomena, critiquing efforts to organize safely among the already initiated amid what she describes as throwaway culture, “the willingness to terminate or cancel people from movements for perceived deviations.” Garza assesses the “barriers to becoming the movement we need to be” as being both internal and external. Externally, she identifies “increased repressions, a retrenchment of systemic racism, and increasingly predatory forms of capitalism” as significant barriers to the movement. But these hardly constitute the entirety of what gets in the way. Garza attributes the internal barriers to being “content to be the God of small things.” She elaborates:  We can’t be afraid to establish a base that is larger than the people we feel comfortable with. Movements and bases cannot be cliques of people who already know each other. We have to reach beyond the choir and take seriously the task of organizing the unorganized—the people who don’t already speak the same language, the people who don’t eat, sleep and breathe social justice, the people who have everything at stake and are looking to be less isolated and more connected and who want to win changes in their lives and the lives of the people they love.  It is worth pointing out that this “cancel culture” within the left is not what its right-wing and liberal critics have claimed. Both have created caricatures of the imaginary power of the left to expel, banish, or punish. But the political intolerance that Garza identifies is hardly an expression of power. Instead, in the absence of real power, left-wing organizing and political communities become the one area where people feel some modicum of control.  In a country brimming over with racist hate speech and a pervasive rape culture, it is not a cardinal sin to elevate what is politically and socially permissible within movement spaces. But there is a difference between establishing mutually agreed-upon standards of engagement and respect and reinforcing a culture of exclusivity that results in further marginalization. Garza and other organizers are grappling with how to raise a level of accountability while also opening doors to new people who are not schooled in this kind of political culture. They are asking different kinds of questions, such as “What will it take to expand our ranks and build our movements broadly?” Phillip Agnew, a former surrogate for Bernie Sanders’s Presidential campaign and an organizer with Black Men Build, describes the approach of his organization in the following way: “Come as you are, grow as you go.” That’s not cancel culture, that’s movement culture.  Garza also takes on the mindless variety of identity politics that often appears within social movements, in which any politics or ideas emanating from those who are racially oppressed or marginalized are assumed to be progressive. Lived experience of oppression does not, alone, constitute radical politics. Indeed, the lived experience of oppression can lead some to draw the worst conclusions about race and gender or the human condition, including the idea that Black people are responsible for their own oppression. Garza celebrates exclusive Black organizing spaces, but she also notes that there are pitfalls to avoid—“the creation of cliques and uniformity of thought.” She describes this as a possibility “when organizers adopt a shallow view of Blackness—Black people as a cool, inherently revolutionary monolith.” People do not come into the world fully conscious of the ways in which they are oppressed and exploited. If they did, then we would have overturned the disorder of this world a long time ago. As Garza argues, “These are the activists who wax poetic about Black power but don’t acknowledge the impact of generations of exclusion, gaslighting, extraction, disenfranchisement, exploitation, domination, and oppression on Black communities.” Experiencing oppression is not nearly the same as knowing what to do about it. That comes from history, politics, and, ultimately, organizing.  Twenty-first-century organizing also means getting back to older forms of politics, Garza writes, letting go of the belief that technology and hashtags can organize movements, or the idea that organizations don’t matter. In perhaps her sharpest comments, Garza uses the Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, whom she describes as a “social media personality,” as an example of confusing online influence with having a political base from which to operate. Mckesson, who became known for his Twitter posts during the Ferguson uprising (and for his bright-blue Patagonia vest), eschewed traditional organizing and instead claimed that social media offered protesters the tools to build movements in new ways. In the fury of the Ferguson moment, McKesson argued that individuals were enough to catalyze a movement:  Individual people can come together around things that they know are unjust. And they can spark change. Your body can be part of the protest; you don’t need a VIP pass to protest. . . . I think that what we are doing is building a radical new community in struggle that did not exist before. Twitter has enabled us to create community. I think the phase we’re in is a community-building phase. Yes, we need to address policy, yes, we need to address elections; we need to do all those things. But on the heels of building a strong community.  Mckesson’s disavowal of the traditional ways of organizing was not an abstraction. His response gained traction because he and his political cohort were angered by the efforts of Black liberal organizations and Black elected officials to dictate the outcome of the protests in Ferguson. They were particularly angered by the entry of the Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, and their criticism of local people who had engaged not only in protests but also in looting, burning, and confrontation with the police. Mckesson and others decided that organizations and in-person meetings were the tropes of this old guard in Black politics, who were much more interested in gatekeeping than in the freedom of young Black people—those who were taking the brunt of tear-gassing and beatings by the police. In this context, Twitter and other social-media platforms seemed new, as did the idea that activists could simply bypass organizations and be the movement themselves.  But other organizers on the ground in Ferguson—such as Jamala Rogers, of Organization for Black Struggle, and those with Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment—were able to hold on to principled criticisms of the formerly charismatic Black preachers who rolled into Ferguson and the Black elected officials who implored young Black people to get off the streets, while also recognizing that transforming rebellion into lasting change required some level of organization and conventional tools culled from grassroots traditions. As Garza points out, it’s easy to misinterpret social-media influence as actual, tangible influence among the broader public. She mentions Mckesson’s failed campaign to become mayor of Baltimore, in 2016, based on the illusion that his social media profile, including his then three hundred and thirty thousand followers on Twitter, could be translated into votes. But in the real world of elections, Mckesson captured a dismal 2.6 per cent of the vote in the Democratic primary—fewer than four thousand votes. Garza concludes, “Hashtags don’t build movements. People do.”  But she has an even more important argument: we don’t have to be beholden to failed models of previous organizing—including relying on top-heavy leadership structures or glorifying men while minimizing the contributions of women—but we can learn from movements past. Garza writes, “Every successful social movement in history was undergirded by organizations: the suffrage movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the anti-war movement. Even in the age of technology, it is a fallacy to believe that organizations are unimportant or unnecessary.”  For Garza, the entire objective of the progressive political enterprise is the pursuit of power. She describes power as “the ability to make decisions that affect your own life and the lives of others, the freedom to shape and determine the story of who we are. Power also means having the ability to reward and punish and decide how resources are distributed.” And, for Garza, the road to power passes through electoral campaigns. She is offering a framework for social change that “requires pressure from the outside, pressure from the inside, and pressure against the structure of the system as a whole.”  She is well aware that this view is controversial within the left orbit she travels in. A large part of what is appealing about Garza’s book is how honestly and directly she delves into political debates within the B.L.M. movement. In 2016, activists around the movement were not only skeptical of Hillary Clinton but also reluctant to support her campaign. Clinton and her husband had built some portion of their political careers on the backs of poor and working-class Black people. And Hillary Clinton’s comments referring to young Black people as “super predators” in 1996 had rightly come back to haunt her candidacy in the throes of a movement against police racism and abuse. But, for Garza, the consequence of that reluctance has been the disaster of Trump. She writes, of the left,  We don’t like politicians, and yet it is politicians who represent us and make decisions on our behalf. We don’t like how power operates and so we shun power, but we need power in order to transform it. The contradictions themselves are not the problem. The problem lies in not being decisive about how we will impact politics so that we can change our own lives and the lives of millions who are suffering under our indecision.  But the dilemma is not simply to vote or not to vote. There is a deeper problem, rooted in the electoral choices that the two-party system presents us with. In a conversation we had about her book, Garza explained that, in this past year’s Democratic primaries, Joe Biden was not among her top five choices. She said that, during the primaries, “I had moments of rage because I, like many people, I think, are so through. Tired of being faced with impossible choices, and it’s not just in the electoral realm, it’s everywhere.” But, at the same time, she told me, “I also was very clear that it was an immediate task.” Last February 20th, Garza and her new organization, Black to the Future Action Fund, endorsed the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. Warren had strong backing from Black feminists, including Black Womxn For, a group of more than a hundred prominent Black women. Garza tweeted that Warren “has the best grasp of how race impacts policy and practice, and she has the best plans for addressing those challenges, and including us in the process. We’re all in—she provides the best terrain for the fight ahead of us.”  Garza attributes Biden’s primary win to the failures of progressives to unite around a candidate. She then goes further and blames some of Bernie Sanders’s supporters for creating “litmus tests around ideology and labels that were and are largely irrelevant for millions of people who are trying to decide where they are going to place their votes.” Garza believes that Warren or Sanders should have left the race; given Black to the Future Action Fund’s endorsement of Warren, she seems to have placed the burden on Sanders, who was often assumed to be the less electable of the two because he described himself as a socialist. Yet Sanders consistently outperformed Warren throughout the primaries. When Garza’s organization endorsed Warren, she was still polling at a distant third or fourth place. It was Sanders who was the front-runner. He ultimately lost after the South Carolina congressman James Clyburn backed Biden, lifting the former Vice-President’s campaign from the dustbin of history. In the immediate aftermath of Biden’s win over Sanders in South Carolina, the remaining Democratic candidates quickly started exiting the race and closing ranks to support Biden.  Sanders’s campaign was not undone because he identified as a socialist. Rather, he was unable to generate the new voters his candidacy needed to survive. Of course, this relates to Garza’s broader point that candidates and political organizations cannot just drop in on communities every four years and expect to have credibility and legitimacy. Ultimately, Sanders was done in by voters’ belief that he could not deliver an agenda that millions of people agreed with in principle. That’s not just cynicism: it’s the reality of our dysfunctional government, which cannot even produce minimal reforms, let alone transformational change.  Garza would argue that this is why communities must be organized around clear demands and be prepared to withhold their support if the demands are not met. It also might be further evidence that we need more electoral options. The fact that the left perpetually acquiesces to the Democratic candidate is part of the reason that the Democratic Party has moved so far to the right. There is no position that any Democratic politician can take that is so noxious that progressives are morally allowed to refuse the candidate. Instead, they are piously called upon to “hold the candidate accountable” while holding their noses over politics they abhor. The problem, of course, is that closing ranks within the Democratic Party has almost always required abandoning the issues that are most important to the left. Even before the final votes in the general election were tallied, the leadership of the Democratic Party began to attack its progressive layer for echoing demands arising from the B.L.M. movement—specifically the demand to defund the police.  Sanders’s candidacy was hardly one of ideological purity; it was a serious effort to engage in politics on different terms, not as they are but as they could be. His campaigns in 2016 and 2020 found broad support for his central issue, Medicare for All. They undoubtedly helped to transform the national debate concerning health care and debt, reinvigorating ideas that government should spend its enormous resources for public provision. Sanders’s ideas had such wide appeal that they shaped the political terrain of the Democratic Party primaries, as candidates raced to demonstrate their progressive credentials. None of this is lost on Garza, but for her the central questions were “Who can win?” and “How does their victory benefit Black communities?”  In some ways, Garza’s response to the earned cynicism of her activist milieu reflects a kind of pessimism that can take hold when movements fail to break through, for all of the reasons she elaborates in the book. In the first iteration of the B.L.M. movement, a popular chant was derived from a poem written by Assata Shakur in her autobiography: “It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win.” But movements don’t win just because they are morally superior and righteous in their ambitions. The success or failure of social movements is a test of timing, and of how many, in the balance of social forces, are on one side versus the other. Political experience and organizing prowess can also make a difference, but social change is hard in a country where the most powerful forces are committed to maintaining the status quo. The lack of a breakthrough can be demoralizing, and it can lead activists to conclude that other methods may be more fruitful in obtaining the outcome they have dedicated so much to securing.  In this country, that has often meant turning to electoral politics to win the elusive goals of justice and greater democratic inclusion. Many of the activists of the Black movement of the sixties transitioned into electoral politics, giving rise to a new heyday of Black mayors and other elected officials, which eventually created the conditions for the political career of Barack Obama. But the resumption of Black activism and rebellion that led to Black Lives Matter was, at least in part, a reaction to the failure of the turn to politics to improve the lives of people in poor and working-class Black communities. Why should we expect a different outcome this time around?  Garza writes that during the 2016 election, three years into her organizing around the call that Black lives matter, “what we learned was that protest is not enough to shift politics as much as we need them to shift. This is the work of governance.” But transforming the lives of Black people and, really, all poor and working-class people in the United States requires more than governance. As Garza suggests, it requires a massive redistribution of wealth—and that will require extraordinary political pressure generated through protest and social movements.  The difficulty that the movement continues to encounter is exactly what Martin Luther King, Jr., confronted when he turned his attention to fighting racism in America’s northern ghettos. He understood that repelling Jim Crow was relatively cheap in the world of politics—by changing the laws, American apartheid could disappear. But changing the conditions wrought by American racism—including poverty, substandard and segregated housing, under-resourced schools, health disparities, and the entrenched racism of American police and the criminal-justice system—would require the wholesale redistribution of wealth and resources in the United States. It would require what King described as a “radical reconstruction” of American society. This realization compelled King to call for massive civil disobedience in Washington, D.C., as part of the unrealized Poor People’s Campaign, which was cut short by his assassination in April of 1968.  Garza writes sparingly about capitalism, even though it has evidently helped to constitute much of the misery that she has spent her adult life organizing against. Her attention is mostly trained on the day-to-day crises that capitalism creates in the lives of ordinary people. That is the important work that social reforms can attend to today. But there are looming systemic crises that most of our elections barely touch, and that require more than the acquisition of political control or governing capability to fully address. The global pandemic is only the most recent evidence that the crises we face as a species are existential. While climate change is the most dramatic evidence of this fact, there is also the spectre of chronic insecurity in obtaining food, housing, health care, and even income—which also poses threats to humanity. This reality raises the bar for what should be expected of politics—the strategies and tactics necessary to change the world, not just elections.  Garza identifies what she sees as the limits of protests, but it is the massive outpouring of protests that erupted over the summer which played a critical role in shifting the consciousness and expectations of millions of Americans. It is also obvious that protests alone are not enough. Of all the elected officials and corporate executives who took to saying “Black Lives Matter” over the summer, very few have followed through with tangible reforms. Garza would say that the lack of a clear Black agenda, along with deep organizing to make it legible politically, has allowed elected officials to willfully ignore demands emanating from Black communities. What we should learn from the latest iteration of the B.L.M. movement is that we need more organization, not less, and that we need clearer points of entry into such organizations for those who wish to do more than just demonstrate. But building successful movements is not just about formulas; it is also about allowing oneself to have what the historian Robin D. G. Kelley describes as “freedom dreams,” to envisage an altogether different world.  This doesn’t mean that electoral politics don’t matter. We have to struggle for what can be obtained and make life better today. But, as Garza writes:  Making America great is ensuring that America remembers that each of us is but a tiny speck on this planet who must learn how to coexist in ways that allow others to live well too. Making America great is making right all that has been done wrong in the name of progress and profit. And at its core, making America great is a commitment to ensuring that everyone can have a good life.  These are tasks that take us beyond what our political system is organized to deliver. Nothing short of mass movements to uproot, overturn, and radically reconstruct can produce the new America envisioned here. Garza’s excellent and provocative new book is a gateway to these urgent debates.  Will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

What started as a poignant hashtag has come to define a generation. In seven years, Black Lives Matter has become a multichapter organization that has changed the very framework with which the nation talks about race.  “The conversation around race didn’t exist in a vast capacity until we saw the BLM movement, this surge,” says T. Sheri Amour Dickerson, executive director and core organizer of BLM Oklahoma City. “Now difficult conversations, honest conversations, and even some discourse, have become part of the daily discussion here in Oklahoma, and I think that goes nationwide in many different factions. It’s also become more intergenerational.”  A movement, a slogan, a rallying cry. Black Lives Matter has had many identities since it was founded on a mission to “eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities ... ” Now, it’s important to ask whether the organization, officially called the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, has made good on its promise to spur positive changes in Black people’s material lives.  Some 30 BLM chapters have popped up across the country since the movement’s inception, many with a set of demands unique to their city’s Black population. BLM members in Los Angeles successfully fought for the firing of Police Chief Charlie Beck. In Chicago, members demand that leaders close the Homan Square detention facility. And in New York, members want a national day of remembrance for victims of police violence.  Over the years, some of these city-specific demands have evolved, some have been successful, and many have gone unmet. Despite any policy failures, though, the movement has helped shift the national conversation about policing and change the way leaders respond to highly publicized acts of police violence. Recently, the BLM network partnered with the Movement for Black Lives to fight for the Breathe Act, a four-part federal proposal demanding that leaders redirect funds from law enforcement entities to community services. And on the heels of BLM’s rise, Garza founded Black Futures Lab, which aims to build Black political power through policy and elections.  It’s worth noting that BLM has come to function as a catch-all for pro-Black, anti-racist efforts that exist independently of the organization. Still, the cultural impact of the term can be felt throughout the nation, and nowhere is this more evident than on social media.  From 2014 to this May, #BlackLivesMatter was tweeted or retweeted 39.2 million times, but the hashtag was shared more than 100 million times in the month after George Floyd was killed, according to a report from Kivvit. The Floyd protests of the summer pushed the movement forward in new ways, the report shows.  At least 62 Fortune 500 companies posted about Black Lives Matter on Facebook in the wake of the summer’s protests. And BLM Facebook posts by popular brands like Nordstrom, Ben & Jerry’s and others saw more engagement than usual posts, according to the report. Before the summer's protests, just two Fortune 500 companies had posted about the movement, the report said.  “Having the technology to where we’re able to actually create international conversation around how race affects each of us is something I’m very proud of,” Dickerson says. “This movement has really moved the needle.”  The movement has also received support from leaders like the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who told BLM protesters in June, “You must be able and prepared to give until you cannot give any more.” The renowned activist Angela Davis praised the movement: “‘Structural racism,’ ‘white supremacy,’ all of these terms that have been used for decades in the ranks of our movements have now become a part of popular discourse.”  And the world has been quick to recognize BLM as a force for change — the global network was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize in 2017, and Cullors appeared onstage at the 2018 Academy Awards. While BLM may not have reached all of its policy-based goals, its social and cultural impact cannot be denied.  Years after its inception, BLM still stands as a critique of the status quo, and has grown so powerful that many often conflate the organization with anti-racism efforts in general. The George Floyd protests of the summer have been called the broadest in the nation’s history, generating more media coverage than any protest in 50 years.  But what appeared to be a changing tide in public opinion has since faded along with the protests. Support for the BLM movement reached a high in June with 67 percent of U.S. adults expressing at least some support for the movement, according to Pew Research. The figure had shrunk to 55 percent by September, Pew reported. Now, 48 percent of American voters support the movement, according to recent tracking data from Civiqs. (The recent number still shows an increase from pre-protest levels.)  The change is most notable among white adults. Their support for the movement reached 60 percent in June before falling to 45 percent, Pew reported (even though white Americans have adopted more liberal racial attitudes overall since the start of the BLM movement).  This has been a common trend throughout history, said Dwight Watson, associate professor of history at Texas State University.  “I expected white folks to disappear,” Watson said. “White support tends to peter away. The way you were taught to understand the world is ultimately how you respond to it in times of crisis. With that said, most young white people did not have an oppositional upbringing to police or the government. So many of them didn’t sign up to die for the cause. And after a while, many of them wondered if the cause is really that important.”  Even for all of its cultural progress, BLM as a movement and an organization hasn’t been immune to criticism. It had been praised for its initially decentralized, leaderless structure, and lauded for moving away from the leadership models of its predecessors, which usually focused on charismatic male leaders.  But some have said BLM has lost its way over the years. Passionate chapters held rallies in response to violence, but what was once viewed as a unique, fresh way of fighting for justice may have, over the years, become ineffective, critics argue. Even Cullors, now the executive director of the global network, has acknowledged the organization’s shortcomings.  “The urgency of Black Lives Matter’s work has dictated our form and function. Often, we have operated in ‘rapid response’ — deploying people and resources to stem, both literally and metaphorically, the bleeding in our communities. We have paid dearly for it,” Cullors wrote in a September letter. “We have leapt into the fray with inadequate funds. We have worked off half-drawn blueprints and roadmaps that led to untenable ends. We have exhausted the most self-sacrificing among us without providing adequate time to recover or a fully-realized vision for the long haul.”  Nonetheless, the movement’s popularity and mission have led to much monetary support. This allowed the global network to offer some $6.5 million in grants over the summer to support grassroots organizing under its BLM Grassroots initiative. The offering was the global network’s commitment to local organizing in 2020 and 2021. But the move to a more centralized structure, and the doling out of millions, has prompted criticism from BLM’s local, on-the-ground chapters.  A recent joint statement from several chapters raised concerns about “financial transparency, decision making, and accountability” in the larger organization. The chapters said Cullors’ appointment as boss and the founding of BLM Grassroots came without the knowledge of many chapters. They also said most chapters have received little to no financial support from the global network since 2013.  “This is not a new conversation we’re having. It’s one that keeps coming up,” said Ariel Lipscomb, an organizer with BLM Denver. “We’ve consistently asked for accountability. We’ve consistently asked for transparency. We’ve consistently asked for shared power and for the actions of BLMGN to reflect the work that we do.”  Jessica Louise, an organizer with BLM Indianapolis, added: “They’ve built their platform off of the idea that Black lives matter. But when you try to privatize and commodify something that belongs to everybody, that’s when you run into problems. The social capital that’s been used to build has been done on the backs of people who are now being told, ‘You’re not part of the club.’ We’re not asking for anything that anyone else would not be asking for.”  Celebrities have reportedly donated millions to the global network, and records show that Thousand Currents, a nonprofit that fiscally sponsors the global network, gave $1.8 million to BLM in 2019. Activists have consistently raised doubts about where the money goes and how local chapters are funded. The statement is a blatant request for answers from chapter organizers who say they rely on direct donations from community members and rarely (if ever) receive financial support from the global network.  “The trickle down ain’t working,” says Vanessa Green, of BLM Hudson Valley, New York.  The Black Lives Matter Global Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.  Despite a lack of resources, local BLM chapters have managed to make influential advances in their communities.  Green says BLM organizers in Hudson Valley managed to convince leaders at Nyack Public School district to implement a policy banning school staff from calling police without first notifying parents when a child is experiencing distress. In Denver, a Covid-19 relief program has managed to provide housing and food for 25 families, Lipscomb says. Louise said the City Council in Indianapolis has agreed to make a pair of review boards civilian-majority entities thanks to BLM organizers. In Washington, D.C., organizers have distributed money and resources to people in need in a massive mutual aid project, says April Goggans, with BLM D.C.  It is this community-focused work that organizers hope will define the BLM organization in the years to come, the chapter members say. Seven years in, the organization is beginning to shift its focus from condemning the powers that be to fighting for new legislation and policy changes. If the current social media stats are any indication of the movement’s future, the cultural phenomenon will maintain its hold on the public — even if that support fluctuates. As for the global network, organizers fear the divide between the international entity and its local chapters will only grow.  “I think more about sustainability than popularity. And I know our work sustains itself because we adapt to the needs of our people,” Lipscomb said.  YahNé Ndgo, of BLM Philadelphia, argues that the BLM Global Network may be more committed to serving the status quo than Black people.  “The actual movement is going to sustain itself because we serve the liberation of our people,” Ndgo said. “Maybe these things will come in alignment, and if it doesn’t then we need to make sure our communities are educated about who are their friends and who are their folks.”  Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

When they arrived, they expected armed Trump supporters.  “We’re not going to be held back at home staying safe because of idle threats of armed Trumpers being here,” said Al Mayo, a Gales Ferry resident, over a megaphone.  He spoke over the hum of military vehicles stationed outside the state Supreme Court across the street. No Trump supporters met them in Hartford, but National Guard troops were standing nearby, weapons in hand.  Security was boosted at state capitol buildings across the country after the Jan. 6 riots in Washington, D.C. Even though the security was prompted by violent far-right extremists, it was also a concern for these Black Lives Matter activists.  “Honestly, it’s a bit scary. For me, it’s really concerning because I know after 9/11, a lot of security was beefed up. But that also resulted in a lot of surveillance and a lot of rights violated,” said Alicia Strong, a Yale student from New Britain. The silver lining, she said, was that the show of force may have kept Trump supporters from showing up.    Strong said the Black Lives Matter movement will continue to hold the Biden administration accountable over the next four years and especially over the next 100 days as the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.  “We don’t think that corporations should be getting all the tax breaks,” she said. “We really think that people should be the priority for the Biden administration -- things like canceling student loan debt, canceling rent and mortgage, things that will help us survive this pandemic and really get through it are what’s important to us today.”  Those in attendance said they were not affiliated with an official group but were activists from throughout the state who previously connected after the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota last year.      Martin Luther King Jr. in Connecticut, a nonprofit organization led by Simsbury High School students, unveiled the town’s newest memorial in honor of the civil rights icon on Monday.     State and local law enforcement agencies blocked off and locked down the Connecticut State Capitol complex Sunday in anticipation of pro-Trump protests that never came to pass.    Some are looking at the 2021 legislative session in Connecticut as an opportunity to turn back major police reform adopted last year in the wake of George Floyd’s killing by a Minneapolis police officer.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  This site is currently unavailable to visitors from the European Economic Area while we work to ensure your data is protected in accordance with applicable EU laws.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Fiery exchanges took place when House lawmakers convened Wednesday to impeach President Donald Trump for a historic second time, just one week after a mob of his supporters attacked the Capitol grounds. As Democrats railed against the insurrectionists, some Republicans repeatedly drew comparisons between last summer's Black Lives Matter protests and the Capitol siege of Jan. 6.  Comparisons between Black Lives Matter and what happened on Capitol Hill are false equivalencies, said several experts and advocates who spoke with ABC News.  'They lit actual flames!'  During Wednesday's hearing, several Congress members made impassioned cases for and against impeaching President Trump. During these speeches, some lawmakers denounced what they called the white supremacy among the Capitol rioters, while others accused Democrats of hypocrisy by supporting Black Lives Matter protests but condemning Trump supporters.  \"If we fail to remove a White supremacist president who incited a white supremacist insurrection, it's communities like Missouri's first district that suffer the most,\" said Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri during her speech in support of impeachment. \"The 117th Congress must understand that we have a mandate to legislate in defense of Black lives, the first step in that process is to root out white supremacy starting with impeaching the White supremacist in chief.\"  Rep. Bush made history as the first Black Congresswoman to be elected in the state. Missouri’s first district has a majority Black population and usually leans blue, according to an election website.  In her speech during the hearing, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., condemned the president for \"radicalizing his supporters\" and \"inciting them to willingly join with White supremacists, Neo-Nazis and para-military extremists in a siege of the United States Capitol building.\"  In a video statement released following the vote, the president condemned last week's violence, but did not take responsibility for his role in the events. In the past, the president has denied accusations of racism. During the final presidential debate on Oct. 22, when moderator Kristen Welker asked the president about racial strife and hate in America, he answered by saying he is the \"least racist person in this room.\"  Instead of rebuking the president for any role in inciting the riot, some Republicans drew comparisons between the Capitol siege and the Black Lives Matter protests that swept across the nation last year following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and several victims of police brutality.  Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida defended Trump, saying \"some have cited the metaphor that the president lit the flames... Well, they lit actual flames!\" accusing Democrats of enabling civil unrest that ensued in some cities during the BLM protests.  The unrest in some cities after some Black Lives Matter protests included vandalism and looting; however, many of these events were rooted in confrontations with police after peaceful protesters left. The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful and leading BLM activists repeatedly distanced themselves from agent provocateurs and instigators.  BLM and the failed Capitol insurrection cannot be compared, according to Cynthia Miller-Idriss, professor of education and sociology at American University and author of \"Hate in the Homeland: The New Global Far Right.\"  \"I don't see a parallel between the two,\" said Miller-Idriss. \"I think making a connection that there was actually incitement of violence or that there's any equivalence in the violence itself, is just absurd.\"  “What happened at the Capitol, you can't call that a protest anymore,” said Miller-Idriss. “That was a riot, it was sedition, it was an insurrection, a siege...it was a domestic terrorist attack.”  Stark differences have been pointed out between the protests for racial justice and the riot stoked by unfounded claims of a stolen presidential election.  2 sets of rules?  The majority white \"Stop the Steal\" mob that stormed the nation's Capitol building was a mix of several right-wing extremist groups, according to Larry Rosenthal, chair and lead researcher of the Berkeley Center for Right-Wing Studies.  Some were members of far-right armed militias. Others were right-wing populists, whom he described as \"rally-goers\" who are \"fanatical about Donald Trump and his presidency.\"  Rosenthal also described two subsets within the extremist groups. One, is comprised of anti-government militias, whom he referred to as \"people who don't recognize the legitimacy\" of government on both state and local levels and often deem themselves \"sovereign citizens.\" The other includes white nationalists, those he said are \"electrified and mobilize[d] going on the streets to stand up to Black Lives Matter and the fantasy of Antifa\".  \"Donald Trump asserts his role as the leader of the right-wing militias,\" said Rosenthal. \"Those people who call themselves 'patriots,' they have lived with the idea of a spark that would lead to the civil war ... it's been in their largely fantasy world for four decades. And suddenly, there is this summons from the president of the United States.\"  There was a \"stark difference\" in the makeup of the Black Lives Matter protests and the Capitol riots, according to professor Mark Anthony Neal, chair of the Department of African and African American Studies at Duke University.  Neal described the Black Lives Matter protests last year as \"a multi-racial social justice movement, much like the civil rights movement in the 1960s.\"  \"Many people of color, Black folks, are killed doing mundane things … just literally sleeping in their home, walking down the block,\" Neal told ABC News. \"What Black Lives Matter was trying to bring to the forefront was the ways in which Black and people of color are always over-policed.\"  Non-violent protesters during the summer faced brute force from federal officers, but rioters were met with minimal federal response.  \"[Rioters] acted with an extraordinary sense of impunity,\" said Rosenthal. \"Like nothing was going to happen to them.\"  Federal authorities launched an active investigation into the attack on the Capitol and there are over 275 open investigations, Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin told reporters on a conference call Friday. As of 8 a.m. Friday morning, the Department of Justice opened 98 criminal cases -- a majority of which are federal felony cases, Sherwin said.  Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said the double standard in policing is \"a long-standing issue of both covert and overt racism and how law enforcement reacts to protest. When Black people are protesting ... there's an over-militarization of communities. \"  \"It was as though two sets of rules apply,\" Morial said. \"One set for these [pro-Trump] protesters and another set for not just Black Lives Matter but also civil rights protests.\"  Motivation behind the movements  Rioters that led the insurrection on the Capitol were a mix of \"far-right extremists\" and self-proclaimed patriots who believe they were called to defend democracy, according to Miller-Idriss. She described how some were \"intentional in their planning\" and arrived \"tactically prepared to storm the Capitol\" carrying weapons, cuffs and mace.  These far-right extremist groups were united by \"a commitment to a tremendous set of disinformation about the election\" citing unfounded claims of massive voter fraud and an illegitimate election, Miller-Idriss said.  President-elect Joe Biden won the election by more than 70 electoral votes. His victory was certified when Congress convened to ratify the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6. However, weeks after the election, Trump continuously pushed false claims and baseless theories of a rigged election, leading some to argue that it incited his followers and contributed to the siege of the Capitol.  The rioters also displayed symbols of white supremacist extremism including a noose stationed across the Capitol which, according to Miller-Idriss, \"symbolizes the horrific history of lynching,\" but also refers to a white supremacy code that signals a \"day of reckoning when traitors will be hung in the streets.\"  These groups were motivated by a sense of threat, Miller-Idriss said -- a \"precarity\" or \"fear of something being taken away\" they believed they deserve is what signaled the attacks on the Capitol, which she said is different from disenfranchisement felt by those supporting Black Lives Matter.  The Black Lives Matter movement was founded in 2013 after the verdict in the murder trial for the killing of Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager who was killed while walking home in Florida.  Amid a racial reckoning in 2020, BLM protests across the country fought against racial injustice, police brutality and advocated for numerous Black Americans that had been violently killed.  Neil said it's important to make the distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement and the Capitol siege.  \"One movement, in the case of Black Lives Matter, is really a critique, an attempt to undermine white supremacy. In the latter case, what happened at the Capitol in January was an attempt to buttress white supremacy.\"  ABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report.  24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n            NPR’s sites use cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about the device you use to access our sites (together, “cookies”) to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR’s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR’s traffic.

Mitigation. Justice.    Happy MLK Day, amid fallout from the churning sickness of white nationalist grievance that finally spewed forth in the attempted auto-coup of January 6, 2021. In that context, we redouble our efforts to topple America’s centuries-old, color-based caste system rooted in colonial occupation, insisting that Black Lives Matter: locally, globally, unconditionally.  Toward that end, here are two events for San Antonio’s DreamWeek that look especially critical in the current moment.  First is “Envisioning Liberation,” an online panel organized by the San Antonio chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace for this upcoming Wednesday. Featuring Black and Palestinian organizers, this panel will discuss the importance of rooting fights for civil rights in the celebration of culture and joy. Given that struggles for liberation are frequently both intense and unending, the question of affect–how to cultivate modes of engagement that allow us to sustain that struggle for the long-haul–is an important one.  Envisioning Liberation: Palestine & Black Lives Matter\nPursuing Happiness in the Struggle for Equality\n6pm-7pm Wednesday\nJanuary 20, 2021\nRegister: TinyUrl.com/PalestineBLM  The second event took place last weekend, but thanks to the beauty of the internet can still be viewed below.  After last summer’s upswelling of protest following the murder of George Floyd, some of the fiercest on-the-ground organizing against local police violence has come from a group called FixSAPD, which has identified key chapters of the city’s contract with SAPD’s police union as primary barriers to holding SAPD accountable in cases of police violence. FixSAPD has collected tens of thousands of signatures aimed at putting these chapters on the ballot, giving local voters the opportunity to repeal them in May’s municipal elections. Click below to watch a conversation with FixSAPD board members about this effort and how to assist:    Enter your email address to receive notifications of new posts by email in real-time.

Image from Durfee's phone.   Dalton native, Lonnie Durfee was in Berkshire Superior Court on Friday accused of violating his bail agreement from the burning of political signs and property in the lead up to the presidential elections, according to court documents.  The 41-year-old Durfee had his conditions extended because of an “escalating pattern of behavior,” according to the Berkshire District Attorney’s office. The conditions were initially in place until Jan. 20. An hour after Biden was sworn into office.  “The Superior Court required that the GPS/curfew provision remains in effect until one hour after the inauguration of the new president,” court documents read. “The presumption at the time was that the political climate, including the rise in violent extremism, would have dissipated by the Presidential Inauguration.”  Durfee got into trouble when on Oct. 9 he set hay bales at the Holiday Brook Farm on fire. The reason for his act of arson was due to a disagreement with the property owner’s sign supporting the Biden and Harris campaign. He was arrested the next day.  However, the Superior Court order also stated that this could be revised if a judge deems Durfee to still be a danger to the community.  Lonnie Durfee, 41, burning a Biden/Harris sign. Image from Durfee's phone.   “We will hold Mr. Durfee accountable and I hope the community uses this incident as a rallying cry to reject fervent divisiveness and hate,” Berkshire District Attorney Andrea Harrington said at Durfee’s arraignment on Oct. 13. Durfee pleaded not guilty.  “The presumption at the time was that the political climate, including the rise in violent extremism, would have dissipated by the Presidential Inauguration,” Friday’s court documents read.  As part of the order, Durfee has to refrain from alcohol and stay at his parents’ home on a curfew in Dalton. Court records show Durfee failed to refrain from alcohol, showing a positive SCRAM at 6:47 a.m. on Nov. 21.  After Durfee’s arraignment, officials discovered more images on his phone which Harrington said established that the burning of the first sign was not an isolated event. She argued that it was not an “isolated act of politically motivated arson, but rather an escalating pattern.”  Lonnie Durfee, 41, burning a Black Lives Matter sign. Image from Durfee's phone.   Images of Durfee in the court documents show him standing next to a black sign with white words reading ‘Black Lives Matter.’ Around the sign, flames lapped up from a metal drum near Durfee’s feet.  “Such an extension is warranted in light of the new facts learned regarding the Defendants pattern of political arson and the escalation of violent extremism in our community and country,” the motion said.

By Daniel Malloy  Patricia and Mark McCloskey, the St. Louis attorneys who famously pointed guns at Black Lives Matter protesters during this summer’s racial unrest in an effort to protect their property, sat for a revealing interview with OZY’s co-founder and CEO on The Carlos Watson Show. You can find some of the best cuts here from the full interview, which you can find on the show’s podcast feed.  Carlos Watson: How do you guys think back about that night as you stand here today in January?  Mark McCloskey: The interesting thing to us is that only that first night, only June 28 ever gets reported by the media. And that was the easier of the two events. The mob came back on July 3 with the express intent of killing us and burning down the house. And now this mob was estimated between 500 and 1,000. And that was the scary night. That was the time when we really thought the end had come. We had a long time trying to get some security and the people we normally hire — in our business from time to time we hire secondary employment cops — nobody wanted to get involved because of the bad press we attract. We were referred to a high-end global security firm that’s based about 50 miles from here.  They’ve gotten bad press over the Ferguson incident and they didn’t want to get involved. The guy finally tells me: “What I’d do is just take whatever you can’t live without, put it in your cars, drive away and just abandon your house.” And I said, “Well, no effing way in heck I’m going to do that. We’re going to go down with this ship if we have to.”  I’ve gotten a call from the White House earlier in the week. And one of the guys at the White House said the president wanted to express his support. If there’s ever anything we can do for you, give us a call, let us know. So now it’s Thursday night before that Friday, July the third, we had every belief that we were going to die. And our daughter who was staying with us came and gave us a hug and a kiss and took her favorite stuffed animal from when she was 3 years old and left thinking she’d never see us again.  And I got back from the White House on the phone and I said, well, you said that there’s ever anything you can do give us a call. So it’s a heck of a good time. And so he gave me Mark Meadows’ cellphone number. I called up Mark Meadows and tell him the story. And then the next call I made was to Tucker Carlson. And I was sitting on the bench in the kitchen and Patty was sitting beside me, sobbing because we thought we were going to die. We had not been to sleep since that previous Sunday night. We’d spent the whole week hiding valuables and stuffing things in walls and under beds and stuff. And Tucker put us on the air and said, “I’m talking to Mark McCloskey,” and I hear Patty sobbing in the background and told the story. When that Friday came, we were pretty certain we were going to die. But it all came together. We had tremendous support at the end. We had some SEALs came up from Texas and from one guy, fourth-generation cattle farmer. A Navy SEAL drove in from Kansas, just put his gear in his truck and drove here. We have support from from the government. As result of Tucker Carlson’s call, there were maybe 10 or so secondary employment cops from rural jurisdictions that weren’t afraid to have their name on the press if they had to.  CW: So, if someone were to say to you, “I hear that, and I hear some of what you’re saying.” They may say, “I don’t agree with all of it. I don’t agree with your characterization of it, but I understand that if you’re outside and there are lots of people out there and there’s noise and there’s concern, and there’s lots of stress all around, I understand how someone could come to that place. But that if you’d stayed in the house, if you’d not pulled guns out, that they would not have come in and that they likely would have just moved on and kept walking through the neighborhood.” You say what to that?  MM: Am I supposed to interview each person as they breached that gate and say, “Are you the good protester or are you the violent mobster? Are you a person who just wants to make some noise so you get on TV, or are you one of those people that shot police officers and burn 7-Eleven’s and kill [police officer] David Dorn?” Am I supposed to individually assess each of these people as they walk through the gate? It’s ridiculous.  I mean, we were terrified, legitimately so, and look what did happen. No shot got fired. Nobody got hurt. Not even a sidewalk got painted. The only casualty that day, other than our psyches, was an iron gate that had been there since 1888. What happened when they leave here? They go to the Mayor Krewson’s house. They shoot fireworks through a window trying to set it on fire. They accost news reporters with semi-automatic weapons. This was not a crowd which you could trust to be harmless, and every indication was that they had no intention of being harmless.  Patty McCloskey: Well, the interesting thing is uninformed people, I see it in the paper, I’ve seen it in a lot of things, saying that this street was chosen because it’s a bastion of white supremacy or white imperialism or something. They don’t know. The neighbor right across the street from me is Black and his father was Black. They’ve been living there since 1972. Next-door to me, a mixed couple, Black and white, with mixed children. I have…   MM: Gay guys across the street next-door.  PM: … gay guys, white guys, Chinese people. I mean, everybody. I mean…  MM: There are 42 houses in this street. As of right now, I think that there are probably what, five? That are African American. Mostly they’re, well, not mostly, I hate to characterize, lots of mixed couples, gay couples, and it’s been that way for the whole 33 years we’ve been there. This has always been about as diverse a neighborhood as you’re going to find in St. Louis.  PM: And liberal.  MM: And liberal. St. Louis, as you may know, is one of the most racially divided cities in the country. I knew that south St. Louis was almost all white, north St. Louis is almost all Black, and there’s very little interchange between the races here with the exception of this specific neighborhood, where it’s always been a mixed neighborhood and no one’s ever had any problem with it.  PM: But I see newspaper articles written saying no Black person would ever be allowed to live there. In fact, “They weren’t allowed to live there,” they say, “under the restrictions.” That was never under our restrictions. That never happened. There have been people here and happily. We’re all happy. It’s kind of shocking that they can say these things. I think that the people that maybe that decided, “Hey, let’s stop in on this particular street because they are all those things you might’ve heard about in the paper,” they’re just uninformed and the paper’s at fault for that.  CW: Do you think on race relations he’s been a good president?  PM: Yeah, I believe so. Because when I see the mainstream news, they’re putting those things together, saying that race relations and prison reform are the same thing. Because we’re putting people in prison, African Americans in prison, for things that you wouldn’t for white-collar crime. So I put those things together, but I think there were opportunity zones, I think he’s set up like in St. Louis. There’s a zone here where he’s bringing in extra help for police to help an African American community. I don’t know any African American that wants fewer cops. He says, I’ll give you more cops because they need help. They’re afraid. I would say 85 percent of our clients are African American and have been for 15 years. And we become very close. We’re not these kinds of people that just say, you know, “Sign you up and we’ll see you. We don’t even know who you are.” We come in and talk to them daily. And I know what they’re like, and I…  CW: Sorry, you said 85 percent. So 85 percent of your clients are African American?  PM: Yes.  CW: And what has happened since this? Have they stayed? Have African Americans continued to be your clients or have they said, “I don’t like what I saw. I don’t like what I heard. I like you as a person, but I don’t respect the choices you’ve made.” And have they chosen other lawyers?  PM: Everyone has said, “I would have done the same thing as you. I talked to my friends that would have done the same thing as you.” One was the girl that I told you about that called and said, “I still love you. And I know that’s not you. And I know that they want you to pay for it.” But not one has left and not one has said. And we’ve gotten calls from clients from way back saying, “I know you people, and I would have done the same thing and I understand it. And so not a one.”  CW: Now, I was surprised in some of the interviews that I thought I heard you say that you supported Black Lives Matter. Is that true? I don’t want to put words in your mouth. Is that true?  MM: My lawyer said it in those words one time and I corrected him, and I’ve corrected it on every media event that’s asked me that question. I support equal justice under the law. I support equal rights for all people. I’m a big believer in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I recognize the Black Lives Matter organization as a Marxist organization. That’s antithetical to everything I believe in. I believe that amongst other things, the biggest impediment to success in the African American community is degradation of family values and the lack of cohesive family organization and Black Lives Matter disavows traditional families, Black Lives Matter disavows…  CW: Mark, Mark, Mark, sorry. You think that’s a bigger impediment to Black success than systemic racism?  MM: I don’t… I can’t answer that question. I can tell you from personal experience of living in the murder capital of the world for most of my life, St. Louis is a remarkably dangerous place if you’re an African American, and that’s because of Black-on-Black violence. So we had 262 murders in the city of St. Louis last year, highest murder rate in 50 years, almost exclusively Black-on-Black violence, and no one wishes to address that issue. And certainly Black Lives Matter does not wish to address that issue.   Former CIA Deputy Director John McLaughlin joined “The Carlos Watson Show.

Thomas B Heffelfinger, who prosecuted law enforcement officers as U.  © OZY 2020 - Terms & Conditions--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  On January 6th, as a Trumpist mob threatened to shut down Congress and the democratic process, a well-known picture of law enforcement bias was made evident once more. As white men and women broke police barriers, smashed windows, and stormed the Capitol, they were often treated with kid gloves by police who seemed surprised these people could turn violent. The contrast with how Black Lives Matter protesters were treated in the same city just months before could hardly have been sharper.  Research by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) provides further documentation of this divide. Over the course of the last several years, ACLED and the Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI) at Princeton University have been gathering data about political violence, protest, and police response.  Based on ongoing data collection, in their analysis, Demonstrations & Political Violence in America: New Data for Summer 2020, Dr. Roudabeh Kishi and Sam Jones found that 93 percent of all demonstrations associated with the Black Lives Matter movement were nonviolent. Yet, according to ACLED, the use of force against mostly peaceful BLM protesters escalated quickly in over 170 events, or nearly one in 10 demonstrations. This level of police intervention is three times that faced by demonstrators in protests unassociated with BLM.  When police mobilize, the use of force is common. As Kishi and Jones detail, “Authorities have used force—such as firing less-lethal weapons like tear gas, rubber bullets, and pepper spray or beating demonstrators with batons—in over 54 percent of the demonstrations in which they have engaged.”  Writing in the Guardian, Lois Beckett reports on broader data that show that “law enforcement was about three times more likely to use force against leftwing versus rightwing protests.”  The disparity in police response only grew when comparing peaceful leftwing versus rightwing protests. Looking at the subset of protests in which demonstrators did not engage in any violence, vandalism, or looting, law enforcement officers were about 3.5 times more likely to use force against leftwing protests than rightwing protests, with about 1.8 percent of peaceful leftwing protests and only half a percent of peaceful rightwing protests met with teargas, rubber bullets, or other force from law enforcement.  These findings would not surprise Letitia James, attorney general for the state of New York. Her office’s review of New York City’s response to protests earlier this year found, as reported by Marty Johnson in The Hill, “a pattern of deeply concerning and unlawful practices that the NYPD [New York Police Department] utilized in response to these largely peaceful protests….The NYPD arrested or detained hundreds of protesters, legal observers, medics and others without legal justification…in total, we found over 155 incidents of officers using excessive and unreasonable force against protesters.”  Chidozie Obasi, writing for Harper’s Bazaar, puts it more plainly:  The differing treatment of the police, which we saw so plainly at the Capitol, says a lot about white supremacy. It exemplifies how much racial disparity is engrained in the nation’s system and how white privilege sits at the heart of racial injustice. In times of political strife and social angst, to see the scary reality of racial inequality taken to extreme proportions, look to the US: if Black people were the ones climbing up walls and causing havoc, the consequences would have been far more devastating. More guns would have been fired and the death toll would have been much higher, all at the hands of white power. To put it simply: if you are white and angry you get away with untold crimes, but if you are Black and show a sentiment of anxiety, if you protest for basic human rights, you are demonized.  ACLED’s researchers warned back in December 2020 that the trajectory of right-wing mobilizations were on the increase, albeit met with very limited government intervention (low levels of force, rare arrests, minimal legal consequences), while the total number of demonstrations involving militias increased dramatically after the election.  The question of how to reform our approaches to law enforcement and policing is being hotly debated.

Louisville, Kentucky – When mass protests erupted in Louisville, Kentucky, on May 28, one of Chanelle Helm’s biggest worries was for the young people who took to the streets.  Anger had been building over the March 13 police killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in Louisville’s West End. Not long after Taylor’s story gained national attention, the world watched footage on May 25 of George Floyd screaming, “I can’t breathe” and crying out for his mother under the knee of a white police officer before going motionless in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  It was not only important for the new people, especially Louisville’s youth, who joined the protest to stay as safe as possible, but also for demonstrators to stay in the streets, Helm, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter Louisville, said.  “I had to do direct action training with them on the fly,” the 40-year-old recalled.  Hundreds of protesters rallied in the city’s downtown, demanding justice for Taylor, who was killed when plain-clothes Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers barged into her home in the early morning hours while serving a “no-knock” warrant.  As the sun went down, tensions rose. Police, dressed in riot gear, fired tear gas and other projectiles. Some protesters destroyed property and set fires. Many people suffered injuries, including seven who were wounded when someone opened fire into the crowd. It was a night that shook Louisville, and for protesters, it was only day one.  In this file photo from May 29, people gather in the street during a protest against the deaths of Breonna Taylor by Louisville police and George Floyd by Minneapolis police, in Louisville, Kentucky [File: Bryan Woolston/Reuters]Protesters, organisers and activists have gathered in some form on most, if not all, of the more than 200 days since then. The groups sometimes number in the hundreds; other times, only a few gather in a downtown park, renamed by protesters as “Injustice Square”. The protests often bring people from Black Lives Matter, Louisville Urban League, Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and other groups.  Seeing protesters gather day-after-day “makes me know that what happens in this part of resistance work and fighting for our freedom, and this continual process of seeing people develop these spaces, that we’re doing exactly what we need to do,” Helm said.  It is a sentiment echoed by Black Lives Matter organisers across the country as they reflect on a year that has brought much pain, but also numerous achievements, and as they chart their priorities moving into 2021.  The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was founded by three Black women – Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi – after the acquittal of the man who shot dead 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2013. Since then, #BlackLivesMatter has borne a global network, other organisations and dozens of local BLM chapters across the United States.  Protests under the Black Lives Matter banner have rocked streets in cities big and small. And organisers have sought to “to eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes”.

But then, the coronavirus pandemic hit, disproportionately affecting Black communities, and BLMLA knew immediately it had to take action.  “We’ve never been just about ending police violence, but about disrupting state-sanctioned violence against Black people,” Abdullah told Al Jazeera by phone. “One of the big priorities with the COVID-19 pandemic was really this history and legacy of medical racism.”  After initially demanding data that examined how the virus was affecting different communities, BLMLA, along with a coalition of other social justice groups and community leaders, issued the “Black Los Angeles Demands in Light of COVID-19 and Rates of Black Death”, which laid out policy demands for elected leaders. BLMLA also convened a coalition of groups to create the People’s Budget, which called “for investments to ensure Black residents have resources in light of COVID-19”.  Abdullah said that initially, very few elected officials responded to the demands. But then Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, prompting what the organiser called the “resurgence of Black Lives Matter”, and chapters across the US saw more people want to get involved.  “‘Defund the police’ has been a mantra for the last five years, but it really became kind of the clarion call of this moment,” she said.

In November, Los Angeles County voters approved Measure J, which requires at least 10 percent of the county’s locally-generated revenue go to community-focused alternatives to traditional incarceration. The county also voted out District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who BLMLA actively protested against this year.  When US media began to float Mayor Eric Garcetti’s name as a possible contender for Cabinet post in the incoming Biden administration, Black Lives Matter LA launched daily #BlockGarcetti protests outside his home. Garcetti acknowledged earlier this month that he will not serve in the administration.  The city council also approved a $150 million cut to the Los Angeles Police Department budget, though it falls significantly short of what the People’s Budget demands.  When US media began to float Mayor Eric Garcetti’s name as a possible contender for Cabinet post in the incoming Biden administration, Black Lives Matter LA launched daily #BlockGarcetti protests outside his home. Garcetti acknowledged earlier this month that he will not serve in the administration.  “What’s really been the priority of 2020 and continues to be our priority as we move into 2021 is really taking advantage of this moment,” Abdullah said. “We didn’t anticipate that everything would change, but as everything’s changing, it’s imperative that we not just kind of tinker around the edges with fundamentally unjust systems, but that we actually take this moment to transform the world in which we live.”  That is the goal of Black Lives Matter in Minnesota, said Trahern Crews, a lead organiser with the state chapter.  When Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in May, the city became the epicentre of summer protests.  “We wanted to help empower” the thousands of people, especially the young people, who protested during those first few days, Crews told Al Jazeera by phone. “We wanted to help them organise.”  One of Crews’s proudest moments was witnessing the solidarity protests that took over hundreds of cities nationwide – and around the world – in the days, weeks and months after Floyd was killed. At the height of the movement in June, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in cities across Latin America, Europe, Australia and Canada to demonstrate against racial injustice.

Not only did Minneapolis protesters take to the streets, but the city also saw an outpouring of support for residents and visitors alike. Activists set up food banks and donation centres with clothing, masks, hand sanitiser and other goods.  “A lot of people were suffering, so it was good to see that we were able to help give back,” Crews said.  Amid the protests, the city banned chokeholds and neck restraints like the one used on Floyd. Officers are also now required to try to stop improper force by fellow officers. The state passed similar police reform legislation in July.  All four officers involved in Floyd’s death face charges.  Some promises – like a commitment from city leaders to dismantle the Minneapolis police department – have stalled in recent months. But BLM Minnesota and other groups have been able to start or reignite conversations around reparations and economic inclusion for Black communities.  In this file photo from June 25, Trahern Crews speaks during a demonstration in front of the 2nd Precinct Police Station in Minneapolis [File: Brandon Bell/Getty Images/AFP]That will continue to be a priority, Crews says, moving into 2021. He also said BLM Minnesota will seek to hold Joe Biden accountable when he is sworn in as US president on January 20.  “Joe Biden wouldn’t have won without the Black people in Detroit, the Black people in Philadelphia, the Black people in Georgia,” Crews said. “So now it’s time for him to keep his part of the deal and do something about police accountability in the US and the wealth gap. It’s a crisis.”  The work of Black Lives Matter chapters has been seen in the streets, legislatures and the ballot boxes of other cities across the US. While the “defund the police” call has faced criticism from politicians – liberals and conservatives alike – several cities have made at least modest cuts to their police departments and reallocated some of those funds to community programmes.  Other cities took significant steps in considering reparations for descendants of slaves. California established a task force to make recommendations on reparations. The issue also gained renewed interest at the national level. Confederate symbols and statues came down. Protesters forced businesses, media organisations and other companies to finally recognise and examine institutional racism and develop policies to address it. And many cities enacted police reforms – albeit not at the level many would like.

Black voters proved instrumental in Biden’s victory in November.  But with all the successes also came setbacks. Ten local chapters wrote an open letter earlier this month, expressing concern with the global network in how recent decisions were made and money has been allocated. BLMGN did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.  According to a Pew study, support for Black Lives Matter surged in June at the height of the protests but fell by September, though the majority of Americans (55 percent) still say they strongly or somewhat support the movement. Among Black Americans, however, support has remained strong.  At the same time, police killings have not stopped. On December 22, an officer killed 47-year-old Andre Hill in Columbus, Ohio. Just weeks earlier, in the same city, a sheriff’s deputy killed 23-year-old Casey Goodson Jr. A Texas officer killed Jonathan Price in October; Dijon Kizzee was killed in Los Angeles in August; Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, Georgia, in June.  According to Mapping Police Violence, police have killed at least 1,066 people in 2020. More than 28 percent of those killed were Black, despite African Americans making up only 13 percent of the US population.  Police also responded to those protesting and documenting police brutality with more police brutality. Thousands have been arrested. Many have been injured.  And Black communities are also still reeling from the effects of the pandemic.  That is why Black Lives Matter organisers and others say the protests and work will not stop.  Back in Louisville, Helm says organisers and protesters will continue their work educating residents about the importance of community power. They have seen an outpouring of support, raising millions of dollars for bail funds that have helped support hundreds of protesters facing charges. Black Lives Matter Louisville has also found housing for people in need and built out their operations to better serve the community.  Under pressure, the city leaders agreed to create a civilian review board (though it still needs work, Helm said). They also banned no-knock warrants, but organisers and activists are calling on Kentucky to pass a statewide version of the ban, known as “Breonna’s Law”.  Protesters are also continuing to demand justice for Taylor and her family. This week, the city’s interim police chief reportedly served pre-termination papers to two officers in Taylor’s case: One who sought the warrant and one who fired the bullet that killed the 26-year-old emergency room technician. Another officer has already been fired. But the family demands charges be filed. “Anything less than criminal charges here by a competent prosecutor is unacceptable,” Taylor’s family lawyers said in a statement on Wednesday.

The police have come in our home and snatched us from our parents, or snatched our parents or others out of homes. We’ve had to visit family members behind bars. We’ve had to mourn, even this year, the loss of family members murdered by the state or inter-communal violence … but we still do the work,” Helm concluded. “They want to see broken people do some f*****-up s***. But we’re not those types of people. We’re going to f*** up, but we’re going to f*** up in a way that gets us free.”  The measure would cut nearly $8m from the $179m policing budget and redirect it to other programmes in the US city.  Citing safety concerns, Minnesota judge says Derek Chauvin can live in a neighbouring state while he awaits trial.  The Trump administration has already arrested more than 300 protesters since the death of George Floyd.  The clips were shown to some media but not released publicly, and reveal the final encounter between Floyd and police.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  BETHLEHEM — After months of contentious debate and multiple leadership turnovers, the Tri-Village Little League voted last week to not put up a Black Lives Matter banner at Magee Field for the 2021 season.  In a statement, the TVLL board wrote that they voted unanimously on Thursday to not put up the Black Lives Matter sign, as well as signs that say “We Support the Bethlehem Police”, “TVLL for LGBTQ”, and “Together One Bethlehem.”  “We discovered that despite our best intentions, the committee's proposal resulted in far more conflict and division within the Bethlehem community than we ever could have predicted or foreseen,” the board wrote.  Ted Hartman, a Little League dad and immigration lawyer who wanted to sponsor the sign, was disappointed in the league's decision.  “It’s unfortunate that once Black folks wanted to be political, they decided nobody can be political,” he said Tuesday.  To explain the decision, the board used a quote from a mother to a Black Little League player the Times Union interviewed in December. At the time, the mother, who asked the Times Union not to use her name, said the drawn-out conflict about the Black Lives Matter sign had defeated the entire purpose.  \"If it's up, that's great. But I think overall, it would have to be so much more widely accepted for it to really be an effective point,\" she said.  The board wrote in their statement last week that they agreed, and for that reason voted to not put up the sign. But other Little League parents were angered by the board’s justification, saying the mom’s comment did not mean the board shouldn’t hang the sign at all.  “They twisted that woman’s statement,” said another Black Little League mom, who also asked the Times Union to not use her name.  The second mother said she was disappointed though not surprised by the board’s final decision, but that she was very offended by the board’s statement. The board wrote that rather than put up the Black Lives Matter sign, they would implement a grant program to allow financially underprivileged families to play at Magee for free and establish an equipment drive to benefit less fortunate areas of the Capital District.  “When you put out a statement and your response is, ‘We’re not going to hang up a Black Lives Matter sign, but we’re going to do a grant program for those less fortunate,’ you’re saying the Black people who want to play won’t be able to afford to play,” she said. “I don’t need grant assistance. I need to know when I’m walking in this town, when my children walk in this town, you accept me and think my life is just as important.”  Sources told the Times Union that throughout the months of debate over the issue, many board members were concerned a sign was superficial and wanted to take actions with more impact.  However, as a result of the board’s decision, the mother decided to pull her children out of the TVLL.  “I don’t need my children to be exposed to some place where, essentially from their statement, I don’t feel like we’re wanted,” she said.  The question of putting up the banner was initially brought to the all-white board in July, when Hartman proposed sponsoring a banner expressing that his law practice supports Black Lives Matter after a police officer knelt on George Floyd's neck in Minnesota, killing him, and sparking worldwide protests about police brutality and institutional racism. Traditionally, signs bearing the names of businesses or organizations that donate to the league are hung at the league's fields.  “It’s about making an inclusive environment in the ballpark,” Hartman said last month. “I've talked to families with kids of color, and they are adamant that they want this to go up to make their kids feel welcome. It would mean everything to them.”  However, some board members resisted the idea, arguing that Little League is not a place for signs that can be viewed as political. While most signs at TVLL bear the names of local business sponsors, there also have been signs for organizations such as the Bethlehem Democratic Committee and the Bethlehem Police Officers' Union, sources said.  Hartman’s proposal was tabled, but the hanging of the other four signs was later proposed, for which the board voted in favor 11-8 in November. After the affirmative vote, however, the all-white board began restarting discussions and mobilized for a re-vote.  Multiple sources familiar with the debate noted the number of police officers on the TVLL board – six out of more than 33 members – as a point of conflict.  “The board is pretty much controlled by police officers, and they are saying that Bethlehem Police Union having a sign is fine,” Hartman said in December, referring to a sign that features the union name and logo, followed by words \"Play Ball.\"  Ultimately, the board decided not only to take down the four signs, but also to not allow the police union to hang their banners at the field anymore.  “In that sense, I am happy that at least we have equality, because before only the police were allowed to be political at TVLL,” Hartman said regarding last week’s vote.  Lee Kindlon, another TVLL dad and a board member, said he is proud to be part of the organization.  “I know there was a lot of debate, and it made us come out of our shell and try and figure out what was best for our community,” said Kindlon, a well-known local defense attorney. “This isn’t the end. This was the first part of a longer conversation that the community is having.”  Do you ever wonder if there's more to the story?

Biden said his granddaughter pointed out the unfair difference in images that showed the violence wielded against Black Lives Matter protesters versus the seemingly muted response against those who attacked the U.S. government.  \"No one can tell me that if that had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,\" Biden said in remarks to the nation Thursday.  Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said Thursday the actions of law enforcement Wednesday highlighted the \"two systems of justice\" in the U.S.  \"We have witnessed two systems of justice: one that let extremists storm the U.S. Capitol yesterday, and another that released tear gas on peaceful protestors last summer,\" she said on Twitter. \"It's simply unacceptable.\"  Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Ohio and former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also questioned law enforcement officials' security efforts.  \"The Capitol police were unprepared, ineffective and some were complicit. All of them should be held to account,\" Fudge, who was still in lockdown by the evening and who has been tapped by Biden to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, told USA TODAY Wednesday night.  Fudge said there's \"no question\" the response was different than at last year's Black Lives Matter protests at the Capitol. She shared a picture of a row of police standing guard on the steps of the Capitol.  \"There is a double standard,'' she said.  As thousands of people of color and allies took to the streets last year to protest police brutality — most of them peacefully — law enforcement often clashed with demonstrators, deploying tear gas and rubber bullets, bruising faces and bodies, and, in one incident that went viral, pushing an elderly man to the ground.  But as thousands of President Donald Trump supporters, mostly white, marched from a campaign-style rally to the Capitol Wednesday and broke into the building as lawmakers were convening to count presidential electoral votes, forcing lawmakers and staff to shelter in place, crowds of law enforcement were notably absent.  Trump, who previously characterized Black Lives Matter protesters as \"thugs,\" said on Twitter that the people involved in the riots Wednesday were \"great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.\"  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that he applauded Capitol police officers who bravely stood in the line of duty against the \"failed insurrection.\"  \"With that said, yesterday represented a massive failure of institutions, protocols, and planning that are supposed to protect the first branch of our federal government,\" he said in a statement. \"A painstaking investigation and thorough review must now take place and significant changes must follow.\"  The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police defended Thursday his agency’s response from criticism that officers did not stop the incursion. Chief Steven Sund said his agency \"had a robust plan\" for what he anticipated would be peaceful protests, but what occurred Wednesday was \"criminal riotous behavior.\"  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., however, called for Sund's resignation and said that House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving, another key security official, had already submitted his resignation. He reports directly to Pelosi, while Sund answers to both the House and Senate. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he’ll fire the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger once he takes control of the Senate for the GOP later this month.  D.C. police chief Robert J. Contee III said the mob of Trump supporters came to Capitol Hill \"following the president's remarks\" and was \"intent on causing harm to our officers by deploying chemical irritants on police to force entry into the United States Capitol.\"  But only a small group of riot police stood outside the back of the Capitol building in the early afternoon, and as rioters called for breaching the building, hundreds started swarming into the area, reporters at the scene noted Wednesday.  As people began climbing up the side of the building and on the back balcony, police appeared to retreat. After the break-in, police attempted to secure one section outside the building but were quickly overwhelmed, according to reporters at the scene.  One video posted to social media showed several people in D.C. Capitol Police jackets removing barriers outside the Capitol building, allowing rioters to pass through to the building. Videos posted to Twitter also showed at least one person who appeared to be an officer taking selfies with people who had breached the Capitol. USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify the identities of the people in these images.  By Wednesday afternoon, Army Gen. Mark Milley said the D.C. National Guard had been fully activated. \"We have fully activated the D.C. National Guard to assist federal and local law enforcement as they work to peacefully address the situation,\" Miller said in a statement.  Several videos shared to social media Wednesday afternoon showed officials slowly escorting people out of the building. One officer in riot gear could be seen helping a white woman in a Trump hat down the Capitol steps, holding her hand, according to a CNN livestream.  By Wednesday evening, nearly a full day after the rioters first clashed with police Tuesday night, officers began using tear gas and percussion grenades to begin clearing crowds, ahead of a 6 p.m. curfew. In the moments before, there were violent clashes between the police and rioters, who tore railing for the inauguration scaffolding and threw it at the officers.  One woman suffered a fatal gunshot wound inside the capitol, Contee said. At least 13 people were arrested, and five firearms were recovered.   By comparison, in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, which sparked last year's protest movement, more than 100 people were arrested over the course of three days in Minneapolis. In subsequent days, cities across the country arrested dozens of people in a single night, with Los Angeles arresting more than 500 in one day.  \"When Black folks are protesting and progressives are protesting peacefully they were tear-gassed, they were arrested, they were shot with rubber bullets. They were shot with real bullets,\" Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, said in a telephone interview. \"We watched it take place all summer long when people were peacefully demonstrating.\"  'A fanciful reality': Trump claims Black Lives Matter protests are violent, but the majority are peaceful  Johnson questioned why the Capitol police and other local law enforcement agencies weren’t prepared for thousands of Trump supporters, including the Proud Boys. There had been plenty of warnings on social media and talk shows about the potential for riots, he said.  \"We should not be witnessing what we are witnessing today in this nation,'' he said. \"It is a global embarrassment.”  Johnson said tens of thousands of people joined protests at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington without this level of violence. \"None of this took place,\" he said.  The majority of Black Lives Matter-affiliated protests over the summer were peaceful, according to a report by the U.S. Crisis Monitor, a joint effort including Princeton University in New Jersey that collects and analyzes real-time data on demonstrations and political violence in the United States.  Kofi Ademola, a local Chicago activist who helped organize civil rights protests throughout the summer, said he was not surprised Wednesday by the police response.  \"It's not any shock that we see this huge contradiction that we can storm a capitol ... break into elected officials’ offices, the chamber, and create other chaos trying to perform a fascist coup, and we see little to no consequences,'' he said.  \"But Black protesters here in D.C. and Chicago, we’re heavily policed, brutalized, for literally saying, 'Don’t kill us.' There was no planned insurrections. We were literally just advocating for our lives. It speaks volumes about the values of this country. It doesn’t care about our lives.\"  CNN commentator Van Jones highlighted the discrepancy in a tweet Wednesday.   \"Imagine if #BlackLivesMatter were the ones who were storming the Capitol building,\" he wrote. \"Thousands of black people laying siege to the seat of government – in the middle of a joint session of Congress? Just imagine the reaction.\"  At the Capitol Wednesday, some lawmakers were holed up in their offices and other places. Several would not say where they were for safety reasons. Staffers were cleared out of the press galleries and the Capitol by the afternoon.  \"The after-action review will determine what failures occurred and why,'' said U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. \"The plans should have anticipated the potential for what happened today.\"  Black Lives Matter Global Network called the law enforcement response to Wednesday's riots hypocritical.  \"When Black people protest for our lives, we are all too often met by National Guard troops or police equipped with assault rifles, shields, tear gas and battle helmets,'' the group said in a statement. \"When white people attempt a coup, they are met by an underwhelming number of law enforcement personnel who act powerless to intervene, going so far as to pose for selfies with terrorists, and prevent an escalation of anarchy and violence like we witnessed today.\"  \"Make no mistake, if the protesters were Black, we would have been tear-gassed, battered, and perhaps shot,'' the group wrote.   The chaos that unfolded Wednesday stands in particularly harsh contrast to the law enforcement presence seen when U.S. and military police drove protesters out of Lafayette Square, located between the White House and the historic St. John's Episcopal Church, shortly before a presidential photo op with a Bible at the church on June 1. Officers used smoke canisters, shields, pepper balls and horses to force demonstrators from the park.  As violent Trump supporters climbed the steps of the Capitol Wednesday, Trey Williamson, of Burke, Virginia, stood nearby while straddling his bike, arguing with those who would listen. He wore a helmet with Black Lives Matter written on it.   Williamson, a food safety director at a large restaurant, was in Washington, D.C., last year when Trump had the streets cleared so that he could take his photo in front of St. John's. \"I got tear-gassed and all I was doing was riding my bike trying to see what was going on,\" Williamson said.  Lafayette Square photo op: How police pushed protesters aside  He said the police response at the Capitol was lukewarm in comparison to what he experienced during Black Lives Matter protests over the summer. \"If there were nothing but Black people up there, there would’ve been a lot of injuries,\" he said. \"It sucks, but I know that this is how it is. I know that because Trump people have felt more comfortable to be at ease with their racism.\"  U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., was holed up in his Capitol Hill office Wednesday as rioters continued their assault on the Capitol. During a Zoom call with reporters, said he and his staff were safe and weren’t leaving. Kind said he intended to return to the House chamber to continue the debate over the certification of electoral votes.  \"Things are still not in control, unfortunately,\" he said.  Kind blamed Trump, who has been reluctant to denounce white nationalists and fraudulently insisted he won the November election, for encouraging the violence Wednesday.   \"When he was encouraging the demonstrations, tweeting out that this was going to be quote 'wild.' I mean, what would he expect the reaction would be, especially when you're talking about the Proud Boys, militia groups, white supremacists coming into our nation's capital today,\" Kind said.  Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., put out a series of statements on Twitter Wednesday calling on law enforcement to engage rioters \"with the same humanity and discipline with which they should have engaged people who were outraged by a police officer kneeling on George Floyd’s neck.\"  \"What many are saying is true: If this were Black Lives Matter storming the Capitol, tanks would have been in the city by now,\" she wrote. \"The response tells the story of our nation’s racist history and present. How can we stop it from being the future?\"  Contributing: Will Carless, Marco R Della Cava and N'dea Yancey-Bragg, USA TODAY; The Associated Press--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n            We recognize you are attempting to access this website from a country belonging to the European Economic Area (EEA) including the EU which\n            enforces the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and therefore access cannot be granted at this time.\n            \n                For any issues, contact web@tulsaworld.com or call 918-582-0921.\n            \n        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \n\t\t\tTrending:\t\t  A Long Beach woman who was charged with attempted murder for driving through a crowd during a Yorba Linda Black Lives Matter protest in September is facing more charges in connection with another attack at an earlier protest in Seal Beach, prosecutors said Wednesday, Jan. 20.  And after reviewing videos from the events of that day in Yorba Linda, five more demonstrators have been charged, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office also announced.  Tatiana Rita Turner, 40, was charged in September after the protest with one felony count of attempted murder with premeditation and deliberation, six felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, including one causing great bodily injury, one felony count of mayhem, and two felony counts of the use of pepper spray by a felon in connection with the Yorba Linda protest.  During that protest, Turner — described as a Black Lives Matter supporter — drove through a crowd of BLM marchers and counter-protesters who gathered to confront them. A man and woman had major injuries and were hospitalized.  On Wednesday, prosecutors revealed that one month before Turner’s action in Yorba Linda, she had also attacked two men at a Seal Beach protest.  In that protest, on Aug. 29, 2020, prosecutors say she used a four-foot rod to strike two men as they lay on the ground after being beaten by a group of protesters.  “The Seal Beach attack left one of the victims with injuries to his head so severe they required staples,” prosecutors said in a statement.  Turner will be charged with two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, including one causing great bodily injury for the Seal Beach attack. Prosecutors said the new complaint with more charges will be filed during Turner’s next court date on Feb. 18.  If convicted Turner, who has previous felony convictions of domestic violence and drug sales, faces up to seven years to life plus 26 years in state prison. Jail records show she is being held in lieu of $1 million bail.  The others charged after the Yorba Linda protest are:  “We support the right to peacefully protest, but these are not peaceful protests,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement.  “These are organized protests that encourage others to engage in civil disobedience and violence. We continue to review all surveillance footage to identify other suspects, regardless of what side of an issue they are on.”  Authorities are still trying to identify suspects involved in the Yorba Linda and Seal Beach protests.

When Black Lives Matter rose to national attention last spring, leadership at the National Academy of Human Resources proposed a project to build a bridge between HR leaders and students at historically Black colleges and universities, particularly three with MBA programs that focus on HR.  Efforts had been underway before the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, but now NAHR President Jill Smart “felt the climate had created an opportunity, and necessity, for these students to talk to—and the white community to hear from—this generation of future Black business leaders,” says consultant and NAHR fellow Ted Childs, a retired diversity executive at IBM who served as coach for the project that emerged.  Related: Diversity and Inclusion from HRE  Starting in September, four students each from Morgan State University, North Carolina A&T State University and Southern University met virtually once or twice a week with Childs and J Tiffany Childs, also an HR professional and her father’s executive assistant. The job for the one undergraduate and 11 MBA students, ages 22-40? To write an article addressing today’s HR leaders about Black Lives Matter, today’s racially charged climate and what needs to be done to create an inclusive workplace for the future.  Ted Childs  “Midway through (the project), I recognized the challenge: my experience attempting to coach (with) a spirit anchored in the integrity of their reality and the 50-year gap between theirs and mine,” Ted Childs wrote in an email last week. “Not a question of right or wrong, but ‘What is possible,’ and finding common ground in our ‘seen reality’—that was HARD. My reality, guided by 75 years of life and growing up in the 1940s–’60s; and theirs, guided by their 21st-century reality, both with a tone of harshness and anchored in the Black experience of each. As I have said publicly and written, I saw Emmett Till’s body in a 1955 casket and read about the circumstances; they saw George Floyd and several others die—on camera. Both harsh, but very different realities.  “Those realities are separated by a calendar that should have led to a different set of social circumstances, and (leaves) a 21st century asking “Why haven’t you fixed this?”  Fred Foulkes, director of the Human Resources Policy Institute and professor at the Boston University Questrom School of Business, and Madelyn Jennings, retired HR SVP at Gannett Newspapers and advisory board member at Morgan State University School of Journalism, served as project mentors.  “Predict the article will be broadly read,” Jennings wrote after reviewing the final product. “The authors are unique for the magazine, and the suggestions are important.”  Below is the article in full, written by:  *  Jump to HR’s call to action  Introduction  Celebrated novelist and poet James Arthur Baldwin once stated: “Know from whence you came. If you know whence you came, there are absolutely no limitations to where you can go.” “Whence you came” is a well-documented journey of inequity that guides our path today. We, young African American HR professionals, cannot ignore its message in charting our own course—or in advising 21st-century leadership.  Prior to the Civil War, approximately 4 million African Americans were a U.S. slave labor force, which equated to a market value of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion. While 150 years have passed since the Emancipation Proclamation, the United States still finds African Americans a valuable part of the labor force, but not in the way one would think. In the year 2020, the American criminal justice prison system held approximately 2.3 million people, with 38.6% of those being African Americans, although African Americans comprise only 13.4% of the American population. Comparatively, in 2016, the United States labor force totaled about 159.2 million people, of which 19.6 million, or 12.3% were Black.  While vividly disproportionate, the statistics are in line with the historical narrative associating “Black lives” with slave labor as permitted in the 13th Amendment, stating “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Consistent with economic history, “Black lives” still are allowed to contribute billions of dollars to the American economy through the production and manufacturing of goods at low labor cost, but not equally as executives and professionals in C-Suite roles. Simply stated, whether as free or paid labor, we can work, but not lead.  Correspondingly, a Harvard Business Review survey found that, on average, Black directors joined their first board sooner than their white counterparts, at age 39.2 versus 42.4; moreover, Black educational attainment was higher and both Blacks and whites dedicated roughly the same amount of time to their board position. However, Black people occupied only 3.2% of senior leadership roles at large companies and just 0.8% of all Fortune 500 CEO positions.  To reiterate the point, note two disparities: 8.6% of our community is selected for Fortune 500 board seats compared to 83.9% of our white peers. It is understanding “from whence (we) came” that enables us not to throw stones but urges us instead to ask, “How can 13% of the population yield 38.6% of our nation’s prisoners but lag by 75.3% in filling its senior corporate leadership positions?” This is a visible disparity, and our personal awareness and business school training tell us this disparity is a cornerstone of the foundational history of Black labor in building the American economy, and that it should be addressed.  Presently, despite equivalent or excelled educational achievement, Blacks are not provided experiences or opportunities comparable to their white counterparts. This disparity is seen in employment considerations and leadership roles at an alarming rate, thereby impacting advancement opportunities that follow development opportunities. Absent the latter, the former will not occur.  Before George Floyd  Notwithstanding, African American intelligence, talent and creativity are not new and are not anomalies. Throughout America’s existence, African Americans have made significant contributions to society, such as the light bulb filament by Lewis Howard Lattimer, the modern-day elevator design by Alexander Miles and the PC by Dr. Mark Dean. Nevertheless, while those contributions have been substantial and continue to influence society, many African Americans have not received proper, if any, recognition or compensation for their contributions.  Equally disturbing is the “new” narrative that the pool of qualified African American talent is shallow. This justification is single-handedly serving as the grounds for the underrepresentation of African Americans in corporate America and the unequal distribution of opportunities that should be driven by ability and not by racial privilege. As a result, hiring decisions are being made based on privilege afforded via birth certificate versus candidate qualifications, assessment factors related to ability or decisions reflective of an unbiased merit-based system.  As an illustration, during the 2017-2018 academic cycle, Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCU) produced 5,467 master’s degrees and 1,550 doctoral degrees, the majority earned by African Americans. This statistic does not include African Americans who earned degrees of identical status from Predominantly White Institutions (PWI). So, how is qualified African American talent hard to find? Thus, highlighting that underrepresentation of African Americans in corporate leadership is not due to a lack of qualified talent, but the lack of recognition and the provision of an opportunity.  Now: 2020 and 2021  As a result of experiencing regular bias, the public execution of George Floyd, the devastating murder of Breonna Taylor and the tragic deaths of other African Americans recently in the hands of law enforcement have sparked national and global outrage. These acts of violence have triggered generational traumas that have been passed down over four centuries in myriad ways. While the decades may have changed, the African American experience is one of consistent struggle against dehumanization, underrepresentation and an overwhelming realization of being undervalued despite making significant contributions to society and the world at large. This injustice and inequity are on full display and no longer primarily centered on police brutality. Disproportionate poverty, incarceration rates, unemployment and underrepresentation in corporate leadership roles are all visible and valid.  While the subject of equal opportunity has been an HR focus item since the 1960s, the failure to achieve some semblance of equity has been evident in two areas: (1) the advancement of qualified African Americans to C-suite and board positions; and (2) the low retention rate of qualified African Americans who are hired. Though hiring individuals from diverse backgrounds is a start, more effort is required to sustain an inclusive workplace. The validation of true intent occurs when employee onboarding, development and advancement lead to the equitable advancement of African Americans to senior executive roles.  A prime example of “validation of true intent” is Xerox Holdings Corp.’s efforts in the 1960s and ’70s. According to the MacNeil/Lehrer PBS NewsHour, Xerox had “solved the Black problem” by successfully recruiting, developing, retaining and advancing Black talent, which led to America’s first Black female CEO, Ursula Burns. Although a notable moment in time, the accomplishment was overstated in the larger context and not adequately sustained. While inspiring, with the existing corporate environment consisting of only 0.8% of African American CEOs, a sense of confidence is not justified for African Americans to believe their professional value will be actively sought or that they will be advanced into executive-level positions. Such discouraging percentages still convey that the name “Tamika” or “Malik” on a resume, with credentials from an HBCU, or arriving at an interview with a natural hairstyle in addition to a dark skin tone, will deter prospective employers where we dream of working and competing. It is especially off-putting when corporate executives express difficulty in finding qualified Black talent.  Efforts made by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy’s partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund for its Hennessy Fellows program to develop leaders from HBCUs is a current example of commitment and initiative surrounding the development and advancement of African American talent to C-suite positions, along with the growth of African American business and socioeconomic status.  Most, if not all, Fortune 500 companies have diversity initiatives to combat employee bias. However, many struggle to fulfill expectations. Most of these are failed attempts due to the method of execution. For example, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are voluntary, employee-led groups within an organization to foster employee engagement and promote diversity. A key challenge is retaining employee participation, and a key example of success is senior leadership engagement, which represents a superb opportunity to work with and get to know ERG members. Their attendance on a regular basis demonstrates the spirit of partnership and an appetite for understanding the issues of different communities.  We all know that, as long as diversity of thought is not shared with one another, we are not progressing. It is simply not enough to have cliques from different groups of employees and call yourself a diverse organization. Our voices have to be HEARD by people who do not look like us. Also, diversity and inclusion is considered to be an “HR” function instead of being considered a cross-departmental function. D&I efforts should be of equal importance across every department of an organization.  Given the changes in demographics and lack of executive-level opportunities for African Americans, we should really examine the whole framework of HR strategy and focus on the hiring process. For example, some companies will hire only graduates from the most elite universities, which are predominantly white. Also, using social media as a source of gaining human capital should be revisited. Yes, it is a market of who you know, not what you know. In fact, 75% of whites polled in one 2014 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute “had no friends outside of their racial group,” per Harvard Review. The trend is not in favor of diversity.  Ultimately, white board members must influence the diversity of the board pipeline and the organization, or else the system of exclusion will continue. In contrast, recruitment efforts must be reexamined with an effective, verifiable strategy being the goal. The implementation of that strategy is the pathway for qualified African American candidates to break through ethnicity-based barriers, while annual DEI reviews with the board should include progress reviews. As the “Catalyst Women on Board” initiative to add women to corporate boards conveyed, real diversity means at least three diverse members on corporate boards and, overall, boards with a racial representation that more proportionately reflects the general U.S. population, and even more importantly, reflects the industry’s marketplace and customers.  21st-century Aspirations  As we have stated, diversity is not a new concept, and neither is the ability to respond to the opportunities it represents. In all environments, “diversity” is critical to the recruitment, development and advancement of diverse talent. Increasingly, the value of diversity is found in displaying moral responsibility, understanding the strategic advantage of varying viewpoints as factors in assuring the long-term survival of a firm. Ultimately, diversity leads to increased productivity, creativity, range of skills, cultural insights and market performance. All of these contribute to better company brand/reputation and better business performance.  Yet, these results cannot be the only motive for a company’s efforts in diversity. Corporate America’s aspiration must be systemic changes that yield improved business performance and a positive societal impact. The reality is that executives promoting workplace diversity cannot be the people who shun the societal debate. They understand the importance and have the skills to positively impact that debate, beyond their organizations, and must recognize that their failure to engage in a deliberate manner is an enabler for bad behavior within our society. More succinctly, we need demonstrated, consistent action from leadership across all areas of our society. Organizations must prepare for future business performance in a society that is experiencing a seismic demographic shift.  Calling upon the efforts of the American business community, we present a narrative that acknowledges the struggles of the past and establishes our vision of an all-inclusive workplace for tomorrow. Toward that goal, we leave you with the following:  Call to Action  1. Start talent development in Pre-K, which provides multiple opportunities to influence lives. Wherever a child can be touched on their educational journey, please use your people, product and financial resources to do so.  2. Get involved in this key challenge facing the Black community: relations with the police. This friction, like the social disruption of the ’60s, threatens the health of a community, and addressing this challenge must include a partnership with business to have a chance to be successful.  6. Finally, select a diverse team of leaders to review all policies looking for any nuance or interpretation that might inhibit any of the above challenges or any other aspect of diversity performance and/or employee relations. This review can include the creation of policies and supportive diversity efforts that reflect our ever-changing global society. However, it must be understood that such reviews require an acknowledgment that bias and privilege exist, and a mandate for senior leadership to address and correct inequities.  Closing  We understand the words of Mr. Baldwin. We know of “whence (we) came,” and the generations on whose shoulders we stand. We are 21st-century HBCU MBA students who value diversity, who seek coaching from our functional leaders in all aspects of our profession, including the pursuit of a new employee/employer compact, and who represent a generation of future leaders who we believe have the required maturity, energy and desire to engage in that discussion.  HR-led digital transformation has never been more vital, says Jason Averbook.  Author Steve Herz sounds off on shifting approaches to leadership.  Stronger teams appear to experience fewer distractions in today's disrupted environment.   By Rani Aravamudhan, MD, CPHIMS  I have been a “remote employee” for most of the last 10-12 years; a physician consultant role in the healthcare tech industry has afforded me the luxury of doing some of my best work in yoga pants and slippers, way before that became the norm for most of the white-collar workforce in 2020. As many adjusted to a new “professional” environment at their kitchen table or a closet under the stairs, Debbie, my next-door neighbor and a registered ER nurse, prepared to work double shifts and 90-hr weeks at Beaumont Hospital. Between shifts, she would come home exhausted; follow an elaborate cleansing ritual and quarantine herself to protect her family. Debbie never left the “office”, in fact she stayed longer and worked harder.  Nine months later, as a vaccine is within reach and rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths reach new heights every day. It’s apparent that our frontline heroes and sheroes will not be getting a reprieve any time soon. Isn’t it essential to ensure the wellbeing of these brave individuals who stock the grocery store shelves, deliver supplies, educate our children, treat and care for the sick…and so much more?  Managing benefit changes to align with the requirements of essential workforces has been wrought with challenges requiring out-of-the-box ideas & innovation from human resources (HR) teams.  Typically, HR executives have followed the time-tested adage of past behavior being the best predictor of future behavior – evaluating utilization patterns over time to make educated projections for the upcoming year. However, given the skewed healthcare consumption caused by COVID-19, these traditional means of assessing year over year trends fall predictably short. For instance, prior to COVID-19 the sharp decline in the number of emergency department (ED) visits would probably signify better access to primary care, however in 2020, one would infer foregone care in critical situations.  Fortunately, data is a malleable commodity. The same data sliced at a different angle or viewed through a creative lens reveals valuable insights driving strategies suited to the need of the hour.  A few strategies HDMS analysts have championed with our clients are outlined here:  Strategy #1: Encourage preventive care   Regrettably, many of us had to put off much needed care in the early months of the pandemic. The impact of this deferred, delayed or forgone care will undoubtedly affect future health outcomes and costs. Hence encouraging resumption of regular follow-ups and preventive care in a safe and controlled setting is a “no-brainer” (e.g., get the annual physical or mammogram that is likely overdue).  As has been widely reported, telemedicine and virtual care adoption is having its moment in the sun. When trends stemming from deferred care are overlaid with that of virtual visits, new insights around closing care gaps emerge (e.g., a previously postponed 6-month follow-up exam for medication management can be easily completed via a virtual visit).  Data analytics can direct energies and efforts to maximize the right employee engagement and craft policies that enhance access to preventive and routine virtual follow up care when appropriate. Metrics that warrant urgent need for action:  Strategy #2: Monitor mental health   Well before COVID-19, studies revealed that behavioral health conditions increased overall healthcare costs. Research by Milliman, spoke to medical costs alone being two to three times more for people with chronic conditions alongside mental health conditions or substance use disorders (SUDs). Widespread reports of COVID-19 induced stress and burnout especially among essential workers is neither novel nor unexpected anymore. (As Debbie said, “It’s like I am on a treadmill that is going faster and faster; I can neither get off nor slow down.”)  Effective modes of support for employees’ emotional wellbeing has been a large part of benefit design conversations for 2021. The key is proactive monitoring & intervention before individuals seek help.  Metrics that warrant urgent need for action:  In parallel, employee surveys can provide valuable info on preferred modes of access to behavioral healthcare (e.g., digital coaching via chat or SMS vs. in-person phone calls) and engagement with available tools and benefits (e.g., utilization of EAP with virtual therapy sessions). These will help drive changes tailored to their unique needs.  Strategy #3: Quantify employee health risks   As “twin-demic 2020” unfolds, with the convergence of the regular flu season with the  surging pandemic, safety of those at higher risk is paramount. By now, unless we have been living on mars, we are all uber familiar with the CDC guidelines on health statuses that pose such increased risk.  Stratifying employee groups- not only based on them, but then pairing that with job roles (e.g., cashiers vs. inventory managers at a grocery chain) and geographic COVID-19 hotspots provides a discernible means of managing such risk. Historic flu infection and vaccination rates yield a quantifiable means of assessing the expected respiratory illness burden- a prime factor necessitating healthcare resources in any community. Thus, improving flu shot compliance rates over previous years will certainly prove advantageous.  Strategy #4: Analyze positive COVID-19 tests  Essential workers are tested often. The results constitute a treasure trove of rapidly actionable data beyond just the obvious (quarantining of affected individual, testing those exposed to them, etc.). Metrics that warrant urgent need for action:  Proactive engagement of those testing positive with care management vendors has served several large employers and plans well. As far as the eye can see, large scale testing will persist well after vaccines are widely available and distributed; hence these measures will stand any employer in good stead well past the crisis phase.  Strategy #5: Build an appropriate wellness plan for now   The fluidity of the current landscape makes it vital for employers to fathom all the health struggles of their most valuable asset- their employees. Childcare with school disruptions, financial stress and elder care responsibilities, can profoundly impact their health, wellbeing and productivity. Causes of all absenteeism—planned and unplanned—can serve as simple and handy indicators of those who might be coping poorly. Appropriate support structures like free telehealth visits, day-care dollars and extended leave policies are not just “nice-to-have” perks any longer. Comparative studies to gage their benefits to member wellbeing and the business health may find the emergence of innovative benefits with individualized products.  Data = Knowledge = Action = Innovation  While SARS-COV2 may be novel, the power of data is not. As industries navigate through the “never have we ever….” phase of evolution, they do not have to view benefits planning as a mere shot in the dark. Existing data ingeniously viewed and utilized can chart the route ahead. In that vein, data scientists should be the new addition to the essential workforce.     Health Data & Management Solutions, Inc.

Support trusted, factual information with a tax deductible contribution to PolitiFact.  \nMore Info\n  \nMembers of the U.S. Secret Service Counter Assault Team walk through the Rotunda as they and other federal police forces responded as violent protesters loyal to President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. (AP Images)\n  Early in the Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, D.C., police used methods designed to dominate the crowd, including chemical irritants and lines of police in full riot gear charging at protesters.   As rioters stormed the Capitol building in January, Capitol Police forces were quickly overwhelmed and showed relative restraint in the immediate aftermath of the attack.   Federal and D.C. forces planned for unrest from Black Lives Matter protesters. Capitol Police planned for a peaceful demonstration by Trump supporters.   Crowd control experts say that once Capitol Police were overwhelmed, de-escalation tactics held the best hope of ending the conflict. ​  The police response to the assault and vandalism of the federal Capitol building has unleashed a wave of comparisons to the summer Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, D.C.   President-elect Joe Biden said the restrained handling of the Trump supporters at the Capitol reflected unequal justice. His granddaughter had sent him a photo of row upon row of soldiers in riot gear guarding the Lincoln Memorial taken in June.    This photo by @MarthaRaddatz at the Lincoln Memorial is deeply disturbing. pic.twitter.com/4cUgxQKh2p  \"No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,\" Biden said Jan. 7.  There is no way to know how events might have unfolded differently if the protesters’ cause on Jan. 6 had been police brutality rather than supporting a president who lost an election. But we can put the clashes side by side.   Already, we’ve documented major differences in the initial posture of police and how both conflicts took shape. And there is no escaping that the people the police faced looked different in the two situations. People of color and whites came out for Black Lives Matter, while whites predominated among the Trump supporters.  Domestic protest researchers said that in the summer, the deployment of forces revealed the official belief that the Black Lives Matter crowd represented a threat, and police took steps to prevent violence. In contrast, despite many red flags, the U.S. Capitol Police expected a largely peaceful protest from Trump’s backers.  That expectation set the stage for the chaos that followed.  After Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, Black Lives Matter protests spread across the nation. On Friday, May 29, around 1,000 people marched through D.C. to call for justice and an end to police brutality. Tensions flared when some protesters stopped at the White House, pushing down metal barriers that separated them from law enforcement before the march continued on through the city.   Around 11:30 p.m. that night, a more intense round of protests took place outside the White House, and Secret Service, D.C. police, and park police used chemical agents to disperse demonstrators. The crowd split apart around 3:30 a.m. after a line of officers advanced through Lafayette Park, holding shields and firing chemical agents.   News outlets reported that the White House briefly went into lockdown, and that Trump was rushed to an underground bunker. However, no protesters penetrated the grounds.   The next day, Trump tweeted that protesters would have met with \"vicious dogs\" and \"ominous weapons\" if they had breached the enclosure. He also appeared to invite his supporters to clash with protesters outside the White House.   In the days that followed, police officers used tear gas, horse-mounted charges, pepper spray, shields, batons and rubber bullets on protesters and journalists covering the demonstrations.   Nearly 300 protesters were arrested on the night of Jun. 1. By the end of the week, 5,800 active-duty troops, agents and officers from a mixture of federal agencies – including the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service, and Immigration and Customs enforcement – had been deployed to the city. Then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper referred to the city as a \"battlespace\" on a call with governors. Armored vehicles patrolled the streets, and helicopters sank low over protesters, generating winds strong enough to shatter glass. The crackdown was aggressive, but no protesters or police died in the District, according to lists of deaths related to the protests compiled by Forbes and the Associated Press.  Fast forward from June to Jan. 6.  When Trump supporters walked up to a portable metal barricade on the Capitol grounds, they saw a handful of officers in their regular uniforms standing on the other side. In the first moments, there was little sense that the marchers would plow through.    The moment it all began. pic.twitter.com/gdyx9Udgc6  But as soon as one person decided to press on, the momentum swelled. The marchers and officers struggled over control of the barricade. The weight of the crowd soon sent officers sprawling backwards. A marcher punched an officer. An officer punched a Trump supporter, and the march became a riot. The police ran back towards the Capitol building, with the mob running close behind.  By 1:15 p.m, a line of police were tussling with Trump supporters on the steps of the Capitol. Rioters shoved police officers, spraying chemical irritants and hitting them with lead pipes. Police deployed flash bangs and pepper spray in an attempt to ward off the crowd.   At 1:46 p.m, Rep. Elaine Luria was evacuated from her office after a report that a pipe bomb had been discovered nearby. \"Supporters of the president are trying to force their way into the Capitol and I can hear what sounds like multiple gunshots,\" she tweeted.   At 2:11 p.m, rioters penetrated the police perimeter on the west side of the Capitol and began to climb the walls. A male intruder shattered windows at the south side of the building and climbed inside with other members of the mob. Ten minutes later, Vice President Mike Pence was escorted from the Chamber.   A video posted to Twitter at 2:21 p.m shows rioters breaking the glass on the doors of the Capitol. Minutes later, police were photographed attempting to talk down the mob after tear gas was set off inside the building. Capitol Police escorted lawmakers and journalists from both the House and Senate Chambers to secure locations. An armed standoff between police and rioters occurred at the doors of the House Chamber. Rioters gained access to the Senate Chamber and paraded around the room.   Around 2:45 p.m., a plain-clothed Capitol Police Officer shot a woman as she attempted to break into the Speaker’s Lobby. The woman – later identified as Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt – eventually died from the injuries.   Around 3 p.m. the Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy activated the entire D.C. National Guard. Agents from the FBI, U.S. Marshal Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were deployed to gain control of the building.   An officer told CNN that police had cleared the Senate floor of rioters by 3:30 p.m., although protesters were still massing in other parts of the building. According to the sergeant-at-arms, the Capitol was finally cleared at 5:40 p.m., 20 minutes before Washington’s curfew set in.   After curfew, law enforcement officers clad in body armor began to use aggressive tactics similar to the ones they had used on Black Lives Matter protesters, advancing on rioters and whacking them with batons.   According to Robert J. Contee III, chief of the city’s Metropolitan police department, 68 individuals were arrested over the course of the night, mostly for violating the curfew order.   The next day, Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died from injuries sustained from engaging with rioters.   In the view of Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, head of the House committee that controls the Capitol Police budget, the assault on the Capitol stemmed from a false premise behind Capitol Police planning.  Ryan said that a week before the march, the Capitol Police assured him that everything was under control. Ryan said he was told they expected a \"pretty vanilla\" protest.  \"There wasn't going to be any kind of violence anticipated,\" Ryan said. \"Maybe some dust-ups. Maybe issues around people trying to get guns into the District of Columbia, where they have very strict gun laws, but absolutely nothing like this.\"  The people who study crowds and police say there was ample reason to plan for a much more aggressive group.  \"There was clear intelligence about where this was headed,\" said Arizona State University criminologist Ed Maguire. \"All you had to do is go on Parler (the alt-right social media platform) for 10 minutes. I was on the night before. They were talking about violence. This is open source material, and the police would have had more.\"  Just a month earlier, a Dec. 12 pro-Trump rally had attracted members of the Proud Boys, a violence-prone group that showed up again on Jan. 6. In December, they were involved in street fights that led to multiple stabbings. The D.C. mayor urged residents to stay home and avoid any confrontation with people coming to the rally.  Ryan said rioters on Jan. 6 came armed with metal pipes and pummeled officers, sending a half dozen to the hospital with head injuries.  The outnumbered and poorly equipped Capitol Police fell back. The mob freely entered the Capitol, and once inside, researchers say the police had limited options to end the chaos.  That situation produced the scenes that have drawn the harshest comparisons to the Black Lives Matter protests. Heavily armed police hugged the walls as the mob swirled past them. One helped a rioter down the steps as she left the building. Another paused as a departing rioter snapped a selfie with a Capitol Police officer.   The grave exception to that atmosphere was when an officer shot and killed a woman as she tried to enter a secure area.   Initially, the police arrested 14 people for unlawful entry to the Capitol. The number grew to about 40. While that is a small fraction of the hundreds that were part of the mob, it is on the same scale as the first arrests of Black Lives Matter protesters — six on the first night and 19 on the second, with hundreds more in the days that followed. (Ryan said U.S. attorneys are tracking down others who breached the Capitol and more charges are expected.)  But as much as the limited effort to make arrests, it’s the casual demeanor of police that has angered Black Lives Matter supporters. They point to that image of soldiers at the ready at the Lincoln Memorial, and the line of officers firing pepper balls and charging at protestors in front of the White House.   Maguire said the comparison is valid. The only reason to use that riot gear and those weapons, he said, is to intimidate the crowd.  \"How the Trump administration handled the BLM protests was draconian and outrageous,\" Maguire said. \"Flexing military muscle and trampling peoples' rights. We had a massive over-response.\"  But the problem on Wednesday was a massive under-response, he said. It’s fine to start with officers wearing a \"soft\" uniform, because that tends to de-escalate tensions. But out of sight, officers in hard riot gear should be nearby, he said.  After Capitol Police lost control, de-escalation became the prime option, said University of Texas-Austin professor Michael Sierra-Arévalo.  \"Tactically speaking, it would be really hard to make an arrest happen when you’re by yourself,\" Sierra-Arévalo said. \"That explains why you didn’t see an escalation of force, until later on, when we saw an influx of law enforcement personnel.\"  One other factor likely shaped the responses of police at the Capitol in ways different from the Black Live Matter protests. That’s the perceived attitude toward the police.  \"Black Lives Matter is viewed synonymously among many police as being anti-police,\" Sierra-Arévalo said. \"Some view it as an existential threat to their job, their profession, and in some cases to their very lives. That’s not something that’s going to be as near the fore when you’re looking out into the crowd and you can quite literally see Blue Lives Matter flags flying somewhere.\"   The chief of the Capitol Police announced he would resign in a week, and two other top officials responsible for security at the Capitol stepped down.

(KJCT) -A few banners were put up early Monday morning on the back of the stands at Stocker Stadium. They were put up for Martin Luther King Junior day.  The city heard about the banners and went to go look at them, but they were already taken down.  The city said that if you are renting the area, you are allowed to put up banners, but the facility was not currently being rented when these banners were put up.  “Whatever group is renting it has the ability to put any banners or any flags, or use the facilities in the way they see fit as long as there is no damage. Certainly, the facility was not rented for these banners,” said Ken Sherbenou, parks and recreation director.  The people who put up the posters wanted to remain anonymous. They did release a statement that said, “”We believe like so many Americans that justice is a staple of a fair and free society. We seek to remind our community that the injustices that sparked Martin Luther King Junior’s movement are still deeply embedded and alive in our institutions.”  It is unknown who took down the banners.

For many New Yorkers who were harassed, arrested or brutalized while marching in support of the Black Lives Matter movement last year, the treatment of the pro-Trump fanatics came as a “slap in the face,” said Roque Rodriguez.  The Sunnyside-based community organizer, who has been protesting in support of BLM and immigrant rights since May, reported being attacked by police during a peaceful post-Election Day protest.   On Wednesday, he watched in disbelief as members of the right-wing mob were “physically assaulting police officers, looting in the Capitol building.”  “If you can see the way that they are treating the quote-unquote ‘protesters’ in DC, and then see the countless videos of how the New York protesters were treated and say that we are being treated the same, and fairly, then you are a wildly dishonest person,” Rodriguez added.  His reaction echoes the frustrations of many New Yorkers who experienced police brutality during protests in the city during the past tumultuous year.  Devin Khan — who was among those struck by a police officer who drove an NYPD SUV into a Brooklyn crowd during a BLM protest in June — said he was “shocked” by the images of unchecked insurrectionists invading Washington, where he grew up.  In New York, he said, “Over the summer you saw people protesting in the street and get tear-gassed or beat,” he said, referring to widespread use of pepper spray by cops. “It’s really almost comical to see the contrast of how the crowds are controlled.”  If BLM supporters had stormed the Capitol instead of violent backers of President Donald Trump, Khan envisions a decidedly different reaction from law enforcement.  “I don’t even think they would have gotten to the gates,” he said.   At least 52 people were arrested in connection with the attack on the Capitol — which left four dead, including a woman who was shot — Washington police told reporters.  More than 40 people were arrested in the first night of protests in New York after the death of George Floyd. Ultimately, hundreds would be arrested over weeks of near-daily protests.  “It’s beyond any imagination,” said Caroline Gombé, co-founder of the New York-based Black Women’s March, which has been protesting in New York and Washington for seven months.  “People got arrested. People were beaten. People were sprayed, maced.… There are people whose lives are not alright. There are people who have serious, serious charges. They need a lot of money for lawyers. Imagine how those people look at that,” she said, referring to the mayhem in Washington.  “They did nothing but protest and they have to deal with all that,” she added. “And then you watch TV and you see a white guy just walking in the Capitol, like, sitting on the [Senate] president’s chair. It’s bitter.”  Dounya Zayer, who was hospitalized after being shoved to the ground by a Brooklyn cop in a May 29 incident caught on video, said she was left feeling “angry and sad” by what she watched on Wednesday.  “Where were the rubber bullets? Where were the mass arrests? Where were the cops beating the s—t out of the rioters? Where was any of it?” she asked.   “It sucks to say that seeing that would have made me feel a little better. It’s sad. But it’s even sadder to see that if you’re white and say ‘Go Trump,’ you get a pass at anything.”  Sign up and get the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to you each morning      Sign up and get the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to you each morning  THE CITY is an independent, nonprofit newsroom dedicated to hard-hitting reporting that serves the people of New York.

These are the now-familiar names of just a few of the many Black people killed by police in 2020.  It was a year that magnified many flaws in America, perhaps none more so than the nation’s mistreatment of people of color.  With each killing, protestors flooded the streets in a unifying demand for change. 2020 was a difficult year in the nation’s long and complex history of race relations. But it was also a milestone year for the Black Lives Matter movement.  Why?  “Because Black Lives Matter has become solidified in the American psyche,” says Kelly Patterson, associate professor in the School of Social Work who studies the intersection of poverty and inequality, as well as race and class. “Blackness matters, and always has. But now there is a heightened awareness of differential outcomes and disparate impacts based solely on the color of one’s skin.”  That was evident, too, last week when a mob of President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the hub of democracy in the U.S., Patterson says. “Even as we watched in horror the insurrection on the American Capitol, almost in unison across news outlets people were asking: ‘What if those mobs had been Black?’”  The May killing of Floyd by police in Minneapolis was clearly the turning point in 2020, Patterson says.  “There was an awakening, mostly by white folks, to a reality that Blacks have been enduring for centuries: Our lives mean less, and are taken for nothing,” she says.  “The Black Lives Matter movement itself is over 7 years old and has accomplished much in that time period, but George Floyd’s murder was a critical catalyst that shifted public opinion in favor of the movement. It propelled a fervency to make change,” says Patterson. “The wave of that change has been seen all across the country, bringing people from all races together to demand symbolic and, more importantly, structural changes supporting the value of Black lives.”  “I feel that was a spiritual sacrifice that propelled us all to think deeper about ourselves and to think about the changes we need in the world,” says Michael Mwenso, a UB visiting professor of the arts and leader of Mwenso & the Shakes, an internationally acclaimed troupe of musical artists. “That moment really changed the whole world. To see that execution happen made what’s going on in the world more real.”  While the movement has been based largely in the U.S., it has had global impact, says Mwenso, who was born in Sierra Leone and raised in London.  “You saw it in places all over the world, where people were reacting to a sort of trauma that I think we’ve been attuned to but never healed from,” he says. “2020 was the year for it to be exposed and for Black people to be able to express themselves and have the space to say, ‘We know there’s been a lot of changes but we know there’s still a lot of BS going on.’”  Mwenso has been teaching a program through the UB Arts Collaboratory, in collaboration with Bronwyn Keenan, titled “Protest, Hope and Resilience through Black Arts.” It’s a personally curated curriculum of history and music that explores how people of color have been agents of positive change and inclusion.  These are the types of programs and conversations that will help push the Black Lives Matter movement forward, he says.    If the events of 2020 created waves of support globally for Black Lives Matter, how can the movement maintain its momentum in 2021?  For starters, “When we say nothing, we are complicit,” says Patterson. “We need to hold ourselves and others accountable, especially those in power, like our employers and public officials at all levels.”  “We need to continually talk about it so it’s not just a healing aid,” Mwenso says, adding that he’s been buoyed by the empathy he has heard in conversations with people from all walks of life over the past year. “We need to find more allies who are white, who are in power, who are able to push forward what needs to change.”  Some of the biggest changes, Patterson says, must now go beyond the symbolic.  “There has to be real systemic change with a focus on housing, education, employment and the criminal justice system,” she says.  These changes would include increasing the production of affordable housing, expanding subsidized housing programs, prioritizing funding for schools and providing substantial funding for targeted job training while improving wages and working conditions.  “And finally, there must be a strong effort to dismantle our broken criminal justice system,” she says. “These changes would fundamentally improve the life chances of Black people in America.”  Both Patterson and Mwenso are optimistic about the movement’s future in 2021.  While many may also find renewed hope that positive change may soon come in the U.S. with a new presidential administration, Mwenso says it’s important to remember who has the real power.  “We cannot rely solely on a new administration,” he says. “We have to realize the power that we have. And that’s really what’s going to change things.”    UBNow encourages discussion and welcomes comments from UB faculty, staff and students using a @buffalo.edu email address.

The series asked artists to share images of and reflections on Dr. King in moments of rest, joy, and celebration.  “This MLK day, BLMGNF is centering life, love, joy, rest, and pleasure. We will not allow white supremacists violence to deter us from the dignity and humanity of Black life,” says Cullors, who is also cofounder and executive director of the foundation. “Every artist in this series was handpicked because each of them center love as part of their work. We know MLK believed in love as the center of his work and at the center of the civil rights movement. Join us in honoring his legacy through this beautiful and transformative artist series.”  The series launches today with works from six artists, Derrick Adams, Shaina Simmons, Christian Scott, Nikki Blak, Rodney Diverlus, and Melanie Jean Baptise Charles, who work in a variety of media, including poetry, dance, music, and visual art. BLMGNF will be sharing more from the series on the foundation website and on Instagram.  “We need a day to dream. A day to center life and leisure,” says co-curator Limar. “We, who believe, like MLK did, in the radical relentless pursuit of freedom, must also stop to dream, to be, to live.”    “This work is inspired by a 1967 Ebony Magazine article titled, MLK’s Tropic Interlude. Martin Luther King, Jr. was in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, for three weeks working “most of the day until way into night” to finish his book, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community? During the last week of his stay, his wife Coretta joined him, and they enjoyed moments of leisure: lounging by the ocean, cooling off in the pool, and dining at a cliffside terrace. The images are important because the most familiar images of MLK show him during his fight for our civil rights. These rare images from Jamaica are a necessary reminder that during our challenging work towards equality, we must also spend time in restorative self-reflection and regeneration, in order to continue and thrive.” – Derrick Adams        A post shared by Black Lives Matter (@blklivesmatter)    “I was honored to create this commissioned piece in honor of one of the most outstanding movement leaders and thinkers of our era, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As the descendant of a child of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, not only do I reap the socio-political benefits of the foundation laid by King and his peers, but I am like so many also incredibly inspired by his legacy. In these times of radical social change, it’s only right that we would reflect on and honor the work of such an iconic leader and movement.” – Nikki Blak     “Simply, an improvisation, a meditation, and a dance party with and for MLK. Using his final ‘mountaintop’ speech in 1968, and Ravyn Wngz’ viral press intervention in 2020 as acts of remembrance, of solemnity and release.” – Rodney Diverlus  Concept/Performance: Rodney Diverlus; Phone Camera Assistance: @Tory_a_; Words from: Martin Luther King, Jr (1968) & @ravynwngz (2020)        A post shared by Black Lives Matter (@blklivesmatter)  Chief Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is a two-time Edison Award winning and five-time Grammy Award nominated musician, composer, and producer. For the series, he premieres the new Adjuah Bow, inspired by “MLK, the beauty of Black history and traditions, reevaluation in the era of misinformation, and love and reverence for Black women.”  “Brooklyn-based singer, songwriter and producer Melanie Charles continues her sonic journey to Make Jazz Trill Again with a meditation on Martin Luther King’s message delivered in his speech, Where Do We Go From Here? In a letter to her higher self, she flows into a mantra to “chill in love” reinforces the need for Black joy, care and relaxation along the road to freedom.” – Melanie Charles  Shot an produced by blue feedback; edited by Rena Anakwe    “Twerk on Washington is a declaration of freedom and healing. Advocating for the decolonization of oversexualizing Black women’s bodies to reclaim an ancient sacred dances of liberation and wellness. Sampling the “I Have a Dream” by the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The shame of traditional African practices is not ours. Trauma is kept in the body, shake it off.” – Shaina Simmons   Produced by Chandel/@mynameischandel; videography by Deondre/@deondres.gallery  RELATED: Fury, Exhaustion, Hope: Black Photographers Turn Their Lenses on the Protests  Stay up to date with everything you need to know about L.A. by following us on Facebook and Instagram.
