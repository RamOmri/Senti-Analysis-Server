Abu Bakr said that Palestinian prisoner Basel Ajaj, 45, is suffering a critical health condition after he caught COVID-19 and entered the ICU.  He holds the Israeli occupation authorities fully responsible for the condition of Ajaj and other prisoners who are suffering from COVID-19.  READ: Global campaign against Israel's vaccine distribution policy  Ajaj has been in prison since 2002 and is serving a life sentence.  Abu Bakr reiterated that the Israeli Prison Services did not take any precautionary measures against the outbreak of COVID-19 among the Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails. \"This accelerated the spread of the virus among them,\" he stressed.  On Thursday, the Palestinian Authority called on the international community to form an investigation mission to investigate the health conditions of the Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails.  Official Palestinian reports state that there are about 4,400 Palestinian prisoners inside Israeli jails, including 40 women and girls, 170 children, and around 380 under administrative detention.

Despite a historic breakthrough in 1993 and many rounds of peace talks since, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is far from resolved. Israel continues its occupation and territorial expansion in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, with hundreds of thousands of settlers now living beyond the 1967 borders and a majority of the current Israeli parliament prepared, in principle, to support annexing West Bank territory unilaterally.\t  Meanwhile, Palestinian governing institutions are eroding, opaque, and unaccountable, while the Palestinian political leadership and people are divided between an extremist Hamas in Gaza and a weakening Fatah-led Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank. Economic and political inequality between Israelis and Palestinians, most starkly in Gaza, further exacerbates the conflict between them. And as Israelis and Palestinians increasingly live in separate spaces, the views on all sides of the conflict are hardening.  This week, I released a new report, co-authored with colleagues Ilan Goldenberg and Michael Koplow, proposing a new U.S. policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rooted in an imperative to take certain tangible steps, both on the ground and diplomatically.  Some analysts argue that there is no available negotiated solution between Israelis and Palestinians at the present time, and so the United States should focus on other issues and work simply to manage the conflict and prevent outbreaks of violence. We disagree. The current situation between Israelis and Palestinians, and between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, is not stable — it is degrading in various ways. This backsliding causes daily harm, including violence, to Israelis and Palestinians living with the conflict, and also shapes the context in which the Palestinian national movement will undergo a high-stakes leadership succession in the coming period. Palestinians are forced to live with the daily humiliations of occupation, while for Israelis, perpetuating the occupation is causing an erosion of democratic values and deep internal political upheaval. Managing the conflict over the past decade has involved three major and several other minor conflagrations between Israel and Hamas, wars that have cost lives, degraded human development, destroyed physical infrastructure, and impaired economic growth. The United States can and must do more to improve the quality of life for Israelis and Palestinians now, while creating more favorable conditions for future negotiations.\n  Donald Trump’s administration fundamentally undercut the U.S. role in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking by taking a one-sided approach, rejecting core principles that underlay Arab-Israeli peace for decades, and aligning the United States with Israeli far-right policies while freezing out the Palestinians. But U.S. policy in the pre-Trump era, under Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, also failed to produce lasting peace, and a simple return to those policies will not succeed. U.S. domestic politics are likely to change the American role as well. As political polarization colors American public attitudes toward Israel and its policies in the conflict, it creates both new constraints and opportunities for U.S. policy.  For decades, the American focus has been on high-profile diplomatic initiatives that aimed for a permanent agreement in which the United States is the central mediator. The quest for a final-status agreement often led American policymakers to give short shrift to the daily harm the ongoing conflict causes to Israelis and Palestinians: the insecurity, violence, economic hardship, and stunted hopes for the future. And that daily harm has itself undermined Israelis’ and Palestinians’ faith in the possibility of coexistence, and their willingness to push forward toward a negotiated peace.  So if no Nobel prize is in the offing for solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but the status quo is too painful and risky to allow, what is the incoming administration to do? Today’s realities demand that the United States change its approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from one focused on a quick resumption of negotiations toward conflict-ending agreement. The United States must focus on taking tangible steps, both on the ground and diplomatically, that will improve the freedom, prosperity, and security of all people living between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, while also cultivating the conditions for a future two-state agreement negotiated between the parties.  In the report, we argue that U.S. policy should focus on the following objectives:  To advance those goals, the report lays out a plan that focuses on three central lines of effort:  You can find the executive summary and a link to the full report here.

By Isabel Kershner and Adam Rasgon  JERUSALEM — Just last week, Israel was seen as a model coronavirus country, outstripping the rest of the world in the pace of vaccinating its citizens by a hefty margin.  But the virus had other ideas.  This week, Israel faces a tightened lockdown as infections have spiraled to more than 8,000 new cases a day, officials fear the more transmissible variant of the virus first identified in Britain is spreading rapidly and Israel’s vaccine supplies are running low.  The prospect that Israel would have the virus under control by spring, once promising, now seems uncertain. Health officials say that in the short term, at least, the vaccine campaign cannot compete with the soaring infection rates.  And the Palestinian Authority, which runs its own health care system in the occupied West Bank, has asked Israel for vaccines, prompting a debate over Israel’s responsibility to the Palestinians at a time when Israel’s vaccine supplies are dwindling.  “We are at the height of a global pandemic that is spreading at record speed with the British mutation,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video statement late Tuesday, justifying the government’s decision to impose a full national lockdown that will shutter most schools and all nonessential workplaces for at least two weeks.  “Every hour we delay, the quicker the virus is spreading, and it will exact a very heavy price,” he added.  The lockdown decision came after Prof. Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, presented the government with the dire projection that without such action, Israel’s infection rate could rise to 46,000 new cases per day by February, a staggering number in a country with a population of about 9 million.  Government officials cited the variant discovered in Britain as one of the main reasons for imposing the tighter restrictions. Mr. Netanyahu said the variant was “leaping forward,” though not at the same pace as it has spread in Britain.  At least 30 cases of the variant have been identified in Israel by special sampling, scattered across 14 different towns and cities, but officials and experts said those tests were aimed at identifying the presence of the variant, not quantifying it, and the actual number of cases was likely much higher.  Many scientists believe that the variant is more transmissible, meaning it may spread more easily from one person to another.  Professor Segal said the variant may be a factor in the soaring infection rate in Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. In the past four weeks, infections among the ultra-Orthodox have increased sixteenfold.  He estimated that the variant now accounts for about 20 percent of the morbidity in ultra-Orthodox towns and neighborhoods.  There have been constant tensions between the ultra-Orthodox, who make up some 12.5 percent of the population, and mainstream Israelis during the coronavirus crisis, in particular over the insistence of some ultra-Orthodox rabbis on keeping their educational institutions open against the regulations during previous lockdowns and generally flouting the restrictions on large gatherings and social distancing.  Casting another shadow over the tantalizing prospect of an early emergence from the crisis, Israel’s vaccine supplies were running low and officials said that they may have to slow down their widely vaunted vaccination program by mid-January unless they can persuade the drug companies to deliver more vaccines sooner than they had promised.  Just days ago, Israelis were celebrating the successful rollout of their vaccination campaign, which has outpaced the rest of the world. About 1.5 million Israeli citizens, or more than 16 percent of the population, have received a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine since the inoculation program started on Dec. 20.  The shortage, officials say, may be a result of the program’s success: the program’s first phase went faster than most thought possible.  Israel has not disclosed the number of vaccine doses that it has received, saying the agreements with the drug companies are confidential. The government has promised to reserve enough vaccines so that all those who received a first dose can receive their second dose as planned after about 21 days. That should include the majority of Israel’s high-risk population of health workers and citizens aged 60 and over.  Quiet negotiations are being held with the drug companies to move up their deliveries, but the shortage could cause delays in the rollout. Mr. Netanyahu, whose political future might depend on the success of the program, said he was “continuing to work around the clock to bring millions of vaccines to Israel.”  Mr. Netanyahu said Wednesday that a small first shipment of Moderna vaccines was to arrive Thursday and that more were forthcoming. Drug companies now see Israel as an interesting test case for the efficacy of the vaccinations and, potentially, as the first country to be fully vaccinated, officials and experts said, giving it an edge in securing additional shipments.  Israel has faced criticism from human rights groups for not extending its vaccine program to most Palestinians living under Israeli control even as Israelis living in West Bank settlements were being vaccinated.  Palestinian officials have recorded hundreds of Covid-19 cases a day in the occupied West Bank and in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, the crowded Palestinian coastal enclave whose borders are tightly controlled by Israel and Egypt, and health officials believe the true numbers are much higher. Palestinians in those areas have yet to receive vaccines.  On Wednesday, two Palestinian officials said that the Palestinian Authority had asked Israel for up to 10,000 doses of the vaccine to immunize Palestinian frontline workers.  Hussein al-Sheikh, the top Palestinian official in charge of coordinating with the Israelis, said that Israel had refused.  An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the news media, said that Israel had secretly supplied “dozens” of vaccines to the Palestinians this week but had not yet responded to the larger request. Several Palestinian officials denied that they had received any vaccines from Israel.  The Oslo Accords, the interim peace agreements signed in the 1990s between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, commit the two sides to cooperate in combating epidemics and to assist each other in times of emergency.  The Geneva Conventions also oblige an occupying power to ensure medical supplies for the local population and the preventive measures needed to combat contagious diseases and epidemics.  Alan Baker, a former Israeli ambassador and expert in international law who participated in the drafting of the Oslo Accords, said he believed that would “place an obligation on Israel to help with the provision” of vaccines to combat Covid 19, but that it was “a two-way street.”  Hamas, he said, is holding Israeli hostages in Gaza and is required by the same humanitarian standards to release them.  Israel’s health minister, Yuli Edelstein, said last week that it was in Israel’s interest to contain the virus on the Palestinian side but that Israel’s first obligation was toward its own citizens. (Palestinian citizens of Israel and residents of East Jerusalem are receiving vaccinations through the Israeli program.)  Dr. Ali Abed Rabbo, a senior official in the authority’s Health Ministry, said that the Palestinians hope to receive two million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in February. They also expect the global vaccine-sharing system Covax to deliver 60,000 doses in the first quarter of 2021 and nearly two million more during the rest of the year.  United Nations officials have asked Israel to provide the Palestinians with some vaccines to help protect their medical workers, said Gerald Rockenschaub, the head of the World Health Organization’s mission to the Palestinians.  But Israel indicated to the United Nations officials that it could not send vaccines to the Palestinians yet because it was dealing with a shortage of shots for its own citizens, Mr. Rockenschaub said.  Advertisement--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip  — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has announced that the first presidential and parliamentary elections since 2006 will be held later this year. But the road to the vote — key to advancing Palestinian statehood and mending a rift between Abbas' Fatah party and the Islamic militant group Hamas — is littered with obstacles.  Parliamentary elections are to be held on May 22, followed by a presidential vote on July 31. The rival factions will meet in Egypt later this month, hoping to work out logistics and settle their differences before election campaigns kick off.  With the aging Abbas at the helm in the West Bank, and Hamas' rule entrenched in the Gaza Strip, there are many outstanding questions. Here's a look at the complications surrounding a Palestinian election:  WHY NOW?  The Palestinians endured four tough years under President Donald Trump, who largely sided with Israel, prompting the Palestinians to cut off ties with the administration. Trump also brokered deals to establish ties between Israel and four Arab countries, shattering a longstanding wall of Arab opposition to normalization with Israel until it made major concessions to the Palestinians. The Trump administration cut funding to the Palestinians, further weakening their position.  While President-elect Joe Biden is likely to take a more balanced approach, he is expected to direct his attention first to more urgent foreign policy issues, such as the Iran nuclear deal. Abbas apparently hopes to start the relationship with the Biden administration on good terms by meeting the West's long-standing demand that he hold overdue elections. Abbas may also have felt pressure from the European Union, one of the most important backers of his self-rule government, the Palestinian Authority. Similar pressure appears to have been exerted by Turkey and Qatar on Hamas.  ___  CHALLENGES AHEAD  Hamas and Fatah have spent years trying to reconcile after a split more than a decade ago. Hamas, considered a terrorist organization by Israel and Western countries, won the last parliamentary elections in 2006, but the international community largely refused to deal with any government that included Hamas figures.  After fierce street battles, Hamas routed Fatah forces and seized power in Gaza in 2007. It retained control of the territory despite an Israeli-Egyptian blockade. Numerous attempts to bring the factions together have failed, with terms for holding elections a major sticking point. Both sides have been unwilling to cede power and compromise — and it's not clear whether attitudes have changed. In Gaza, Hamas has created its own government bureaucracy, along with an armed wing and a stockpile of rockets aimed at Israel. Abbas, who oversees autonomous zones in the West Bank, opposes violence as a means of ending more than half a century of Israeli occupation.  An additional roadblock is the uncertainty about holding the vote in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, sought by Palestinians as a future capital. Israel captured east Jerusalem, home to about 300,000 Palestinians, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with Gaza and the West Bank. Israel considers all of Jerusalem as its capital. While Israel permitted voting there under a less hard-line government in 2006, it could now view a vote as undermining its control and block it. Palestinian Central Election Commission chief Hanna Nasser said Saturday that officials have asked Israel about allowing voting in east Jerusalem. Abbas has said it is essential for such voting to take place.  ___  QUESTIONS REMAIN  Abbas, 85, has led the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization since the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004. While he has repeatedly said he would not seek another term as president, he has not groomed a successor. It's possible that he will run again. Several senior Fatah members in their 60s and 70s consider themselves as potential candidates, but no clear favorite has emerged. Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the second Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation, has done well in opinion polls, but is serving multiple life terms in an Israeli prison, complicating any candidacy.  A challenger from Hamas is also up in the air. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who led the group's electoral list in the 2006 vote, left Gaza in 2019 for what was billed a regional tour, never to return.  Haniyeh, who now leads the movement's decision-making body, was for years the group's self-styled prime minister, running Gaza during the blockade and three wars with Israel. As a candidate and later head of the territory's government, Haniyeh portrayed himself as an average person still living in the crowded al-Shati refugee camp on the edge of Gaza City, but that image did not last long. People in Gaza, many poor and jobless because of the blockade that was imposed in response to Hamas' policies, whispered about Haniyeh's rumored wealth. Since he left Gaza, images of his often luxurious stays in hotel suites in Qatar have leaked online, a jarring contrast to the grim reality of Gaza's 2 million people.  © 2021 StarTribune.

The “Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act” provides $250 million over five years to expand “people-to-people” Israeli and Palestinian grassroots programs, some of which which could ultimately also shore up the Palestinian economy.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  The Israeli government must stop ignoring its international obligations as an occupying power and immediately act to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are equally and fairly provided to Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, said Amnesty International today.  On 23 December, the Israeli Health Ministry began the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Having already given initial jabs to more than a 10th of its population, Israel has been hailed as the country that has to date achieved the widest vaccination coverage in proportion to its population size. However, the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out plan so far covers only citizens of Israel, including Israeli settlers living inside the West Bank, and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem. It excludes the nearly 5 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, under Israeli military occupation.  “Israel’s COVID-19 vaccine programme highlights the institutionalized discrimination that defines the Israeli government’s policy towards Palestinians. While Israel celebrates a record-setting vaccination drive, millions of Palestinians living under Israeli control in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will receive no vaccine or have to wait much longer – there could hardly be a better illustration of how Israeli lives are valued above Palestinian ones,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.  “Israeli authorities must ensure that vaccines are equally provided to the Palestinians living under their control, in order to meet their obligations under international law. They must also ensure smooth entry of vaccines and other medical equipment to the OPT, including making any necessary logistical arrangements to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines.”  The Israeli Ministry of Health has not yet publicly formulated an allocation policy that includes reserving specific amounts of doses for Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), nor has it established a timeline for the disbursement of these vaccines to Palestinian health authorities.  Over half a century of occupation and enforcement of a system of institutionalized discrimination in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, Israel has deprived Palestinians of their basic rights and committed mass human rights violations. Israel must end its discriminatory policies and remove any barriers that may hinder Palestinians from accessing or enjoying health care.  Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law include the duty of ensuring and maintaining “the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics”, as per Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.  As of 3 January 2021, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 159,034 Palestinians in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, have so far tested positive for coronavirus since the first confirmed case was reported in March 2020. There have been nearly 1,600 deaths related to COVID-19 among Palestinians in the OPT since the beginning of the pandemic.  As the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and de facto Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip cannot independently fund vaccines and their distribution among the Palestinian population, they depend on global co-operation mechanisms such as COVAX, which still has not begun distributing vaccines. Israel must provide full financial support to ensure that the vaccine is promptly distributed to the Palestinian population without discrimination. Israel must also lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip to enable the proper functioning of its health system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaza’s health care system – subjected to half a century of occupation and more than a decade of blockade – is already unable to meet the needs of its population. The COVID-19 pandemic and lack of fair access to vaccines have only magnified the discrimination and inequality faced by the Palestinian population.  “The Israeli government must uphold its obligations as the occupying power, under international humanitarian law and human rights law, to provide the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to the population of the OPT without discrimination,” said Saleh Higazi.  “The views of marginalized groups must be at the forefront of any decision-making to ensure that national vaccine policies aren’t exclusionary or discriminatory. All states must confront existing inequalities to ensure everyone has access to vaccines.”   On 22 December, 10 human rights and health organizations issued a statement calling on Israel to ensure that its vaccination campaign includes Palestinians living under Israeli occupation.  In early December, Israel reached an agreement with Pfizer pharmaceutical company to supply 8 million doses of its newly approved COVID-19 vaccine – enough to cover almost half of Israel’s population of nearly 9 million since each person requires two doses. Israel also reached a separate agreement with Moderna to buy 6 million doses of its vaccine – enough for another 3 million Israelis.  As the race to distribute COVID-19 vaccines gathers pace, Amnesty International calls on states and companies to ensure that no one is denied access to health care, including vaccines, because of where they live, who they are or what they earn.  Background  There are approximately 600,000 Israeli settlers residing in 256 settlements and outposts scattered across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law.  On 3 January 2021, the Israeli Health Ministry said that 435,866 people in Israel had so far tested positive for the coronavirus since the first confirmed case was reported in February 2020. Almost 3,400 people have died in Israel, it said.  Reports indicate that the first batch of 313,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses arrived in Israel in early December 2020, and the country was expected to receive 3.8 million additional doses by the end of December 2020.  The Palestinian authorities have nominal and limited jurisdiction over parts of the occupied West Bank in accordance with interim peace agreements reached with Israel in the 1990s. Israel captured the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip following the 1967 war.  The Palestinian authorities hope to obtain vaccines for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip through a WHO-led partnership with humanitarian organizations known as COVAX, which aims to provide vaccines to up to 20% of the population of all participating countries, many of which have been hit especially hard by the COVID-19 pandemic."
